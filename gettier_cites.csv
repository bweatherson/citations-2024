This article argues that thought experiments are a powerful tool for harnessing scholarly imagination with enormous potential for international relations (IR). To provide guidance for thought experiments' incorporation into IR research, the article begins by clarifying thought experiments' epistemological foundations and expanding existing best practices criteria for minimal-rewrite counterfactuals. Doing so enables consideration of the diversity of thought experiments useful to the discipline, ranging from alien invasions to zombie apocalypses. Then, the article outlines five ways in which thought experiments prove particularly useful in researching international politics: probing modal consequences of macro-level theories; refining concepts; formulating hypotheses; speculating about rare events; and conveying theories' real-world implications. To facilitate thought experiments' incorporation into mixed- and multi-methods research, the article's final section offers a novel typology to guide scholars in not only formulating new thought experiments, but also adapting and comparing them, including in conjunction with empirical methods.","[Lerner, Adam B.] Royal Holloway Univ London, London, England; [Lerner, Adam B.] Royal Holloway Univ London, Polit & Int Relat, London, England; [Lerner, Adam B.] Royal Holloways Ctr Int Secur RHISC, London, England",University of London; Royal Holloway University London; University of London; Royal Holloway University London,"Lerner, AB (corresponding author), Royal Holloway Univ London, London, England.",,,"Lerner, Adam/0000-0002-6715-3197",,,,,62,0,0,0,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0020-8833,1468-2478,,INT STUD QUART,Int.

Although many of the more drastic measures applied within educational settings have since ceased to apply, at least for the time being, we are not yet 'past Covid': many of the challenges that are discussed here still exist. As we faced unprecedented disruption to economies, societies and education systems, the global health pandemic drew attention to existing inequalities and presented a clear picture of steps required for addressing the education of close to one billion students whose learning was hampered due to school closures. The magnitude of this challenge was and still is starkly manifest with the digital divide on the African continen. Democratization of education has been perceived to include facilitation of both formal and epistemic access (including allocation of new technologies for teaching and learning), reconceptualization of knowledge, truth and learning, recognition of 'other standpoints for knowledge' and 'very different knowledge registers,' recovery of 'lost knowledge resources' and connection of 'multiple ways of knowing,' and respectful engagement 'with indigenous and local knowledges,' idea that merit critical interrogation.","[Horsthemke, Kai] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Educ, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Horsthemke, K (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Educ, Johannesburg, South Africa.",Kai.Horsthemke@gmail.com,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1744-9642,1744-9650,,ETHICS EDUC,Ethics Educ.,OCT 2,2022,17,4,,,,,373,387,,10.1080/17449642.2022.2148382,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17449642.2022.2148382,,NOV 2022,15,Education & Educational Research,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Education & Educational Research,6U0QH,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000889308100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To answer this question, theorists have explained the exclusion of statistical evidence by arguing that legal proof requires certain epistemic features. In this paper, I make two contributions to the debate. First, I establish the Criminal Verdict Asymmetry, a previously-unarticulated asymmetry between the epistemic norms of guilty and not guilty verdicts. I argue that the prosecution and defense's different epistemic burdens influence whether statistical evidence can generate the type of verdict each side pursues. Second, I point out a mistake in how theorists have understood the role of statistical evidence in criminal trials. Though epistemologists have primarily focused on whether statistical evidence can generate specific epistemic features required for convictions, I consider whether statistical evidence can demonstrate a lack of such features. I find that there are epistemic advantages to allowing the defense to introduce statistical evidence which can reveal the prosecution's failure to prove the defendant's guilt.","[Fried, Avital] Univ Oxford, Philosophy Fac, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Fried, A (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Philosophy Fac, Oxford, England.",avital.fried@trinity.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,55,0,0,1,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0039-7857,1573-0964,,SYNTHESE,Synthese,NOV 9,2022,200,6,,,,,,,472,10.1007/s11229-022-03947-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11229-022-03947-w,,,15,History & Philosophy Of Science; Philosophy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),History & Philosophy of Science; Philosophy,6G9OY,,hybrid,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000885081500001,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Kelp, C",,,,"Kelp, Christoph",,,Defeat and proficiencies,PHILOSOPHICAL ISSUES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Virtue epistemology is the view that beliefs are attempts at truth (or perhaps knowledge) and, as a result, can be assessed as successful, competent, and apt. Moreover, virtue epistemology identifies central epistemic properties with normative properties of beliefs as attempts. In particular, knowledge is apt belief and justified belief is competent belief. This paper develops a systematic virtue epistemological account of defeat (of justification/competence). I provide reason to think that defeat occurs not only for beliefs but for attempts more general. The key constructive idea is that defeaters are evidence that attempting (in a certain way) isn't successful and that defeaters defeat the competence of an attempt when one stands in a certain normative relation to the defeater. I argue that while this account handles paradigm cases of defeat both within epistemology and beyond nicely, cases of external (sometimes also 'normative' or 'propositional') defeat continue to cause trouble. To handle these cases, I develop a distinctively functionalist version of virtue epistemology. This functionalist version of virtue epistemology allows me to countenance proficiencies, that is, roughly, abilities that have the function to produce successes under certain conditions. It is the normative import of proficiencies that delivers the normative relation that serves to explain defeat in cases of external defeat. In this way, the functionalist version of virtue epistemology ushers the way towards a satisfactory account even of external defeat.","[Kelp, Christoph] Univ Glasgow, COGITO Epistemol Res Ctr, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow,"Kelp, C (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, COGITO Epistemol Res Ctr, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",christoph.kelp@glasgow.ac.uk,"Kelp, Christoph/AGK-3359-2022","Kelp, Christoph/0000-0001-7735-2109",,,,,51,1,1,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1533-6077,1758-2237,,PHILOS ISSUES,Philos.

We built a mathematical framework that makes it possible to define learning (increasing number of true beliefs) and knowledge of an agent in precise ways, by phrasing belief in terms of epistemic probabilities, defined from Bayes' rule. The degree of true belief is quantified by means of active information I+: a comparison between the degree of belief of the agent and a completely ignorant person. Learning has occurred when either the agent's strength of belief in a true proposition has increased in comparison with the ignorant person (I+ > 0), or the strength of belief in a false proposition has decreased (I+ < 0). Knowledge additionally requires that learning occurs for the right reason, and in this context we introduce a framework of parallel worlds that correspond to parameters of a statistical model. This makes it possible to interpret learning as a hypothesis test for such a model, whereas knowledge acquisition additionally requires estimation of a true world parameter. Our framework of learning and knowledge acquisition is a hybrid between frequentism and Bayesianism. It can be generalized to a sequential setting, where information and data are updated over time. The theory is illustrated using examples of coin tossing, historical and future events, replication of studies, and causal inference. It can also be used to pinpoint shortcomings of machine learning, where typically learning rather than knowledge acquisition is in focus.","[Hossjer, Ola] Stockholm Univ, Dept Math, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Diaz-Pachon, Daniel Andres; Rao, J.

This account uses the same ingredients as the traditional analysis-belief, truth, and justification-but posits a different relation between them. While the traditional analysis begins with true belief and improves it by simply adding justification, this account begins with belief, improves it by grounding it, and then improves it further by grounding it in the facts. In other words, for a belief to be knowledge, it's not enough that it be true and justified; for a belief to be knowledge, it must be justified by the facts. This account solves the Gettier problem. Gettierized beliefs fall short of knowledge because, albeit true and justified, they are not grounded in the facts.

If we adopt explication as our research methodology, which consists in the application of the criterion of logical validity to organize various propositions of perspectives we encounter in research in terms of a disagreement, we discover: (a) what the British identified as Hinduism was not characterizable by a shared set of beliefs or shared outlook, but a disagreement or debate about basic topics of philosophy with a discourse on tenets of moral philosophy anchoring the debate; and (b), the Western tradition's historical commitment to language as the vehicle of thought not only leads to the conflation of propositions with beliefs, but to interpreting (explaining by way of belief) on the basis of the Eurocentric tradition rooted exclusively in ancient Greek philosophy. Interpretation on the basis of the Western tradition leads to the Western tradition vindicating itself as the non-traditional, non-religious, rational platform-the secular-for explaining everything-the residua are what get called religions on a global scale. This serves the political function of insulating Western colonialism from indigenous moral and political criticism. Given that Western colonialism is the pivotal event, before which South Asians just had philosophy, and after which they had religion (the explanatory residua of Eurocentric interpretation), we can ask about Hindu religious belief. This only pertains to the period after colonialism, when Hindus adopted a Westcentric frame for understanding their tradition as religious because of colonization. Prior to this, the tradition the British identified as Hindu had a wide variety of philosophical approaches to justification, which often criticized propositional attitudes, like belief, as irrational.","[Ranganathan, Shyam] York Univ, Dept Philosophy, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada; [Ranganathan, Shyam] York Univ, York Ctr Asian Res, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada",York University - Canada; York University - Canada,"Ranganathan, S (corresponding author), York Univ, Dept Philosophy, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.;Ranganathan, S (corresponding author), York Univ, York Ctr Asian Res, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.",shyamr@yorku.ca,,"Ranganathan, Shyam/0000-0003-1644-3538",,,,,69,1,1,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-1444,,RELIGIONS,Religions,OCT,2022,13,10,,,,,,,891,10.3390/rel13100891,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rel13100891,,,29,Religion,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Religion,5Q2HM,,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-07-12,WOS:000873658200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The correctness of Gettier's argument is questioned by showing that Smith of his famous examples does not earn justification for his incidentally true beliefs, while a doxastically more conscientious person S would come to hold justified but false beliefs. So, Gettier's (and analogous) cases do not result in justified and true belief. This is due to a tension between deductive closure of justification and evidential support. For being justified, any believing, disbelieving, or withholding of deductively inferred propositions must be distributed proportionally to given evidential support. This proportionality principle has primacy over deductive closure in case of conflict. Although the author's argument does not save the JTB-account, it explains why subjects in Gettier situations do not earn knowledge.","[Schramm, Alfred] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Inst Philosophy, Graz, Austria",University of Graz,"Schramm, A (corresponding author), Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Inst Philosophy, Graz, Austria.",alfred.schramm@uni-graz.at,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,3,BRILL,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0165-9227,1875-6735,,GRAZER PHILOS STUD,Grazer Philos.

J,"Novaes, CD",,,,"Novaes, Catarina Dutilh",,,Two Types of Refutation in Philosophical Argumentation,ARGUMENTATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Elenchus; Socrates; Aristotle; Gettier problem; Lakatos; Counterexamples,,"In this paper, I highlight the significance of practices of refutation in philosophical inquiry, that is, practices of showing that a claim, person or theory is wrong. I present and contrast two prominent approaches to philosophical refutation: refutation in ancient Greek dialectic (elenchus), in its Socratic variant as described in Plato's dialogues, and as described in Aristotle's logical texts; and the practice of providing counterexamples to putative definitions familiar from twentieth century analytic philosophy, focusing on the so-called Gettier problem. Moreover, I discuss Lakatos' method of proofs and refutations, as it offers insightful observations on the dynamics between arguments, refutations, and counterexamples. Overall, I argue that dialectic, in particular in its Socratic variant, is especially suitable for the philosophical purpose of questioning the obvious, as it invites reflection on one's own doxastic commitments and on the tensions and inconsistencies within one's set of beliefs. By contrast, the counterexample-based approach to philosophical refutation can give rise to philosophical theorizing that is overly focused on hairsplitting disputes, thus becoming alienated from the relevant human experiences. Insofar as philosophical inquiry treads the fine line between questioning the obvious while still seeking to say something significant about human experiences, perhaps a certain amount of what Lakatos describes as 'monster-barring'-a rejection of overly fanciful, artificial putative counterexamples-has its place in philosophical argumentation.","[Novaes, Catarina Dutilh] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Novaes, Catarina Dutilh] Univ St Andrews, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; University of St Andrews,"Novaes, CD (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Novaes, CD (corresponding author), Univ St Andrews, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland.",c.dutilhnovaes@vu.nl,,"Dutilh Novaes, Catarina/0000-0002-7347-3795",European Research Council [ERC-2017-CoG 771074],European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)),"This research was generously supported by the European Research Council with grant ERC-2017-CoG 771074 for the project 'The Social Epistemology of Argumentation'.

I discuss a group of influential views of epsiodic memory that I characterize as 'two-factor accounts', which have both proved popular historically (e.g., in the work of Hume, 1739-40; Locke 1690; and Russell 1921) and have also seen a resurgence in recent work on the philosophy of memory (see, e.g., Dokic 2014; Michaelian, 2016; Owens, 1996). What is common to them is that they try to give an account of the nature of episodic memory in which the concept of knowledge plays no explanatory role. I highlight some parallels between these two-factor accounts and attempts to give a reductive definition of knowledge itself. I then discuss some problems two-factor accounts of episodic memory face in explaining the distinctive sense in which episodic recollection involves remembering personally experienced past events, before sketching an alternative approach to episodic memory, which takes as basic the idea that episodic memory involves the retention of knowledge. I argue that we can give an exhaustive constitutive account of what episodic memory is, and how it differs from other types of mental states, by considering what particular type of knowledge is retained in episodic memory, and what exactly having that knowledge consists in.","[Hoerl, Christoph] Univ Warwick, Dept Philosophy, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Hoerl, C (corresponding author), Univ Warwick, Dept Philosophy, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",c.hoerl@warwick.ac.uk,"Hoerl, Christoph/N-4097-2019","Hoerl, Christoph/0000-0002-3370-4747",,,,,88,3,3,0,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0039-7857,1573-0964,,SYNTHESE,Synthese,SEP 6,2022,200,5,,,,,,,376,10.1007/s11229-022-03702-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11229-022-03702-1,,,27,History & Philosophy Of Science; Philosophy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),History & Philosophy of Science; Philosophy,4I4LO,,hybrid,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000850549900002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The goal of this effort is to comprehend the knowledge that remains beyond the human domain, e.g., of the artificial cognitive systems. This theory occurs in two versions, weak and strong. The weak version is limited to knowledge in which retention and articulation are performed through the discourse. The strong version is general and is not limited in any way. In the weak version, knowledge is represented by the trajectories of discourses in time, in a dynamical space called the discursive space, which has an arbitrary number of dimensions. Given space is used to represent a given part of knowledge. A manifold is introduced to represent knowledge with a wider scope (all knowledge). The strong version is an extrapolation of the weak version to cover all forms of knowledge, not necessarily human or manifesting in language. The use of dynamical space construction allows one to formalize knowledge as such. Such an effort requires us to initially consider knowledge as mainly a social and linguistic phenomenon, which also could be presented as a result of the evolution of the understanding of knowledge that took place in the 20th century.","[Maciag, Rafal] Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Informat Studies, PL-30348 Krakow, Poland",Jagiellonian University,"Maciag, R (corresponding author), Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Informat Studies, PL-30348 Krakow, Poland.",rafal.maciag@uj.edu.pl,"Maciag, Rafal/S-6549-2016","Maciag, Rafal/0000-0003-1812-3538","National Science Centre, Poland [2018/29/B/HS1/01882]","National Science Centre, Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)","This research was funded by the National Science Centre, Poland, grant number 2018/29/B/HS1/01882.",,130,1,1,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2409-9287,,PHILOSOPHIES,Philosophies,AUG,2022,7,4,,,,,,,72,10.3390/philosophies7040072,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/philosophies7040072,,,17,History & Philosophy Of Science; Philosophy,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),History & Philosophy of Science; Philosophy,4B5DD,,gold,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000845797000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

They are cases in which an epistemic agent has a belief that is both justified and true, but intuitively cannot be taken to count as knowledge. Modal epistemology is the field of philosophy that tackles questions regarding the sources of our knowledge of modalities (possibility and necessity) and what offers justification for beliefs about what is possible or necessary. Part of the tradition in modal epistemology is to consider conceivability as a guide to metaphysical possibility. As such, if an agent can conceive that P, then the agent is justified to believe that P is metaphysically possible.

One picture holds that successful communication requires identity of content: The speaker has a belief that she expresses with her utterance, and the hearer acquires a belief with the same content by understanding the utterance. The second picture was proposed by Lewis in his classic work Convention and then refined in Languages and Language. It sees communication as coordination among speakers-a technical notion that Lewis draws from game theory. Samuel Cumming has recently provided an elegant and insightful synthesis of the two pictures, arguing that Lewisian coordination among speakers is in fact a form of content identity. In this paper, my negative goal is to argue against Cumming's attempt to construe coordination as content identity, showing that it yields incorrect predictions about certain cases of successful communication. My positive goal is to show how we can avoid Cumming's problematic interpretation of coordination and still do justice to the relevant data within a coordination-based framework.","[Onofri, Andrea] Univ Autonoma San Luis Potosi, Fac Ciencias Sociales & Humanidades, Ave Ind 101-A, San Luis Potosi 78399, San Luis Potosi, Mexico",Universidad Autonoma de San Luis Potosi,"Onofri, A (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma San Luis Potosi, Fac Ciencias Sociales & Humanidades, Ave Ind 101-A, San Luis Potosi 78399, San Luis Potosi, Mexico.",andrea.onofri@uaslp.mx,,"Onofri, Andrea/0000-0003-0663-797X","Secretaria de Educacion Publica (Mexico), Apoyo a la Incorporacion de NPTC [UASLP-PTC-646]","Secretaria de Educacion Publica (Mexico), Apoyo a la Incorporacion de NPTC","Part of this research was funded by: Secretaria de Educacion Publica (Mexico), Apoyo a la Incorporacion de NPTC, project UASLP-PTC-646.",,58,0,0,1,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0039-7857,1573-0964,,SYNTHESE,Synthese,JUN 21,2022,200,4,,,,,,,268,10.1007/s11229-022-03757-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11229-022-03757-0,,,20,History & Philosophy Of Science; Philosophy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),History & Philosophy of Science; Philosophy,2H4IA,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000814259000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

These imagined situations have been conspicuously ineffective at resolving conflicting intuitions and deciding between the different accounts of personal identity. Using prominent examples from the literature, I argue that this is due to many of these thought experiments not adhering to the methodological standards that guide experimental design in nearly all other disciplines.

Specifically, I argue that the unconscious rejection of conceptual analysis as a philosophical method by contemporary African philosophers played a major role in how African philosophy came to be characterized by a relevance-demand. Consequently, I submit that even though being only or excessively relevance-oriented is not bad, African philosophy would become rich enough to compete with other regional philosophies-Western, Chinese, and so on-if it re-installs conceptual analysis as part of its methodology.","[Omoge, Michael] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto,"Omoge, M (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.",michael.omoge@utoronto.ca,,"Omoge, Michael/0000-0002-6010-4093",,,,,46,0,0,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0556-8641,1996-8523,,PHILOS PAP,Philos.

The first is that the most innovative contribution of Timothy Williamson, Herman Cappelen, and Max Deutsch (a.k.a., the intuition deniers) in the debate about the epistemology of thought experiments is not the denial of intuition and the claim of the irrelevance of experimental philosophy but the claim of epistemological continuity and the rejection of philosophical exceptionalism. The second is that a better way of implementing the claim of epistemological continuity is not Deutsch and Cappelen's argument view or Williamson's folk psychological view (i.e., off-line simulation). This is so because while the argument view makes the basis of the relevant classificational judgement evidentially too demanding; the folk psychological view makes it too weak and error-prone to count as an adequate explanation. Drawing from a certain reading of Aristotle's Nichomachean Ethics that flowers in Miranda Fricker and John McDowell, I argue for the reason-responsiveness view. Like the extant views, the reason-responsiveness view vindicates the claim of epistemological continuity. But unlike the extant views, it does not share those problematic features. Further, I show that the reason-responsiveness view offers a way for champions of the claim of epistemological continuity to resist Avner Baz's objection to the claim of epistemological continuity and his objection to the philosophical use of thought experiments while taking on board some attractive elements of his view.","[Irikefe, Paul O.] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff CF10 3AT, Wales",Cardiff University,"Irikefe, PO (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Cardiff CF10 3AT, Wales.",IrikefePO@cardiff.ac.uk,,"Irikefe, Paul/0000-0003-4086-8229",,,,,119,0,0,0,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0039-7857,1573-0964,,SYNTHESE,Synthese,APR 28,2022,200,3,,,,,,,191,10.1007/s11229-022-03690-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11229-022-03690-2,,,29,History & Philosophy Of Science; Philosophy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),History & Philosophy of Science; Philosophy,0V8LK,,hybrid,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000788591400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

First, it is not clear that propositional knowledge is incompatible with the forms of epistemic luck with which knowledge-how is allegedly compatible.

In this paper, I raise a problem for the functional approach which concerns the existence of harmful and methodologically insignificant concept functions. I examine whether we can deal with these problematic functions by adopting a technical notion of function. I thus review the prospects for using the notions of a contextually stable function, of a designed function, of a proper function, and of a system function as our operative notion of function. None of them help us resolve the problem. On this basis, I argue that advocates of the functional approach should be committed to a comparatively weak claim, according to which functions must be assessed case-by-case, and that we are best served by employing an unsophisticated notion of function, according to which the function of a concept just is something the concept is used for.","[Jorem, Sigurd] Univ Oslo, Dept Philosophy Class Hist Art & Ideas, Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Jorem, S (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Dept Philosophy Class Hist Art & Ideas, Oslo, Norway.",sigurd.jorem@gmail.com,,"Jorem, Sigurd/0000-0002-6168-6080",,,,,40,8,8,0,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0039-7857,1573-0964,,SYNTHESE,Synthese,APR,2022,200,2,,,,,,,106,10.1007/s11229-022-03548-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11229-022-03548-7,,,20,History & Philosophy Of Science; Philosophy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),History & Philosophy of Science; Philosophy,0I4YR,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-07-12,WOS:000779427400010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Williamson's view of evidence is, of course, a crucially important aspect of his novel and influential knowledge-first epistemological project. Notoriously, one crucial thesis of this project is that one's evidence is equivalent to what one knows. This has come to be known as the E = K thesis. This paper specifically addresses Williamson's knowledge-first epistemology and the E = K thesis in the context of anti-luck epistemology (i.e., the view that knowledge is not compatible with certain forms of epistemic luck) and the idea that knowledge is factive (i.e., the view that knowledge implies truth). Williamson's views on these matters are worth investigating in some detail because he subscribes to a well-worked out anti-luck view of knowledge that incorporates what is perhaps the most common anti-luck condition (i.e., the safety condition). But this paper is also of more general importance because the critique of Williamson's views on these matters reveals some important things about the nature of evidence and evidence is one of the most fundamental concepts in epistemology.","[Shaffer, Michael J.] Gustavus Adolphus Coll, Dept Philosophy, OM 104,800 West Coll Ave, St Peter, MN 56082 USA",Gustavus Adolphus College,"Shaffer, MJ (corresponding author), Gustavus Adolphus Coll, Dept Philosophy, OM 104,800 West Coll Ave, St Peter, MN 56082 USA.",shaffermj66@outlook.com,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0353-5150,1874-6349,,ACTA ANAL,Acta Anal.-Int.

There is a tradition of cashing out safety-defining modality in terms of possible world semantics (as put forward by Duncan Pritchard), and even Julian Dutant's and Martin Smith's normalcy-based notions of safety also take this semantics as a significant component of them. However, such an approach has to largely depend on epistemologists' ad hoc intuitions on how to individuate possible worlds and how to pick out close worlds. In contrast, I propose a probabilistic approach to safety to maximally preclude the preceding type of ad hoc-ness. The main idea is as follows: Each epistemic vignette wherein a subject S holds a true belief p has to be evaluated by a safety-ascriber, hence, S holds a true belief p safely iff according to the safety-ascriber's evaluation (which is based on her background knowledge), the probability of the occurrence of the truth-maker of p is above a pre-fixed safety threshold.

A Test of Pragmatic Performance Factors in Theory of Mind Tasks,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Theory of Mind; pragmatics; true belief; false sign task; knowledge; false belief,PRESCHOOLERS; 5-YEAR-OLDS; COMPETENCE; INFANTS,"The litmus test for the development of a metarepresentational Theory of Mind is the false belief (FB) task in which children have to represent how another agent misrepresents the world. Children typically start mastering this task around age four. Recently, however, a puzzling finding has emerged: Once children master the FB task, they begin to fail true belief (TB) control tasks. Pragmatic accounts assume that the TB task is pragmatically confusing because it poses a trivial academic test question about a rational agent's perspective; and we do not normally engage in such discourse about subjective mental perspectives unless there is at least the possibility of error or deviance. The lack of such an obvious possibility in the TB task implicates that there might be some hidden perspective difference and thus makes the task confusing. In the present study, we test the pragmatic account by administering to 3- to 6-year-olds (N = 88) TB and FB tasks and structurally analogous true and false sign (TS/FS) tasks. The belief and sign tasks are matched in terms of representational and metarepresentational complexity; the crucial difference is that TS tasks do not implicate an alternative non-mental perspective and should thus be less pragmatically confusing than TB tasks. The results show parallel and correlated development in FB and FS tasks, replicate the puzzling performance pattern in TB tasks, but show no trace of this in TS tasks.

This is the context of the recent contributions collected in D'Oro & Overgaard (Eds.) (2017), from which we try not necessarily to initiate a dialogue between different philosophical paradigms, but rather to make explicit their differences and similarities. The present paper aims to analyze the theoretical inputs on the methodological role of intuitions in the philosophical field, specifically on the topic of epistemic disagreement. An optimistic perspective of this disagreement is proposed, following Cappelen (2017) and Ichikawa (2016). In particular, an attempt is made to try to answer the question of whether the persistence of disagreement constitutes a reason to rule out that there is philosophical progress. Similarly, the scope of fake news as an epistemic input that prevents the attainment of so-called evidential neutrality is assessed.","[Miranda-Rojas, Rafael] Univ Catolica Maule, Ctr Invest Relig & Sociedad, Curico, Chile",Universidad Catolica del Maule,"Miranda-Rojas, R (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Maule, Ctr Invest Relig & Sociedad, Curico, Chile.",rafaelmirandarojas@gmail.com,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,0,"UNIV AUTONOMA MADRID, SERVICIO PUBLICACIONES",MADRID,"CIUDAD UNIV CANTOBLANCO, MADRID, 28049, SPAIN",1576-3935,1887-505X,,BAJO PALABRA,Bajo Palabra,,2022,2,30,,,,,97,122,,,,,,26,Philosophy,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Philosophy,F9HM4,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000985385600005,View Full Record in Web of Science

I aim to bring closer together largely separate literatures in practical reason and in epistemology. I focus on three questions. First, is basing causing? Causal theories of basing remain popular despite the notorious Problem of Deviant Causal Chains. Causal theorists in both the epistemic and practical domains have begun to appeal to dispositions to try and solve the problem. Second, how unified are acting and believing on the basis of reasons? I consider an important challenge to their unity due to Setiya. I sketch a response, which posits unity of causal structure across acting and believing on the basis of reasons. Third, how does acting or believing on the basis of a good reason relate to acting or believing on the basis of a reason simpliciter? I generalize a recent argument of Lord and Sylvan's to include acting as well as believing. The conclusion is that, for both believing and acting, phi ing on the basis of a good reason does not amount to phi ing on the basis of a reason that just so happens to be good.","[Blake-Turner, Christopher] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Philosophy Dept, Univ Hall,5th Floor 1402,10th Ave South, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham,"Blake-Turner, C (corresponding author), Univ Alabama Birmingham, Philosophy Dept, Univ Hall,5th Floor 1402,10th Ave South, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA.",cblaketurner@uab.edu,"Blake-Turner, Christopher/AAG-3638-2020","Blake-Turner, Christopher/0000-0002-1509-0649",,,,,70,1,1,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,1747-9991,,PHILOS COMPASS,Philos.

We argue that Washo offers evidence that both complementation and modification are available strategies for subordination, and in doing so contribute more generally to the ongoing debate about how clauses are embedded by attitude verbs. We observe that the embedding strategies of certain predicates in Washo follow from independent properties of clause types in the language. On the one hand, clauses embedded by presuppositional verbs come in the form of clausal nominalizations, which are selected as thematic internal arguments. The DP layer in these complements is responsible for encoding familiarity in a general sense (along the lines of Kastner 2015) both in these complement clauses as well as in other constructions in the language. On the other hand, clauses embedded by non-presuppositional verbs are not selected at all; they are instead adjunct modifiers, which follows from the fact that the attitude verbs they modify are always intransitive. This aspect of the analysis lends support to the property-analysis of 'that'-clauses (e.g., Kratzer 2006; Moulton 2009; Elliott 2016), but only in certain instances of embedding. We argue that the Washo facts show that selection still plays a role for some verbs, contra theories that do away with it altogether (Elliott 2016), but selection cannot explain everything either, as non-presuppositional verbs are intransitive and do not select at all.","[Bochnak, M.

We need a systematic account and criticism of it both as a debate-winning strategy of argumentation and teaching method. The Speaker introduces an issue pretending to be at a lower intellectual level than her co-debaters, or Participants. An Audience looks over and evaluates the results. How is it possible that the Speaker like Socrates is, consistently, in the winning position? The situation is ironic because the Participants fight from a losing position but realize it too late. Socratic irony compares with divine irony: divine irony is a subtype of Socratic irony since you lose when you challenge gods. Socratic irony is also, prima facie, a subtype of dramatic irony when the Audience knows more than the Participants on the stage. We must distinguish between the ideal and realistic elements of Socratic Irony. The very idea of Socratic irony looks idealized, or it is an ideal case, which explains the Speaker's consistently winning position.

Individuals, however, are not the only bearers of knowledge. Many epistemologists agree that groups can also possess knowledge in a way that is genuinely collective. If groups can know, it is natural to think that, just as true individual beliefs fall short of knowledge due to individual epistemic luck, true collective beliefs may fall short of knowledge because of collective epistemic luck. This paper argues, first, that the dominant view of epistemic luck in the literature, the modal view, does not yield a satisfactory account of lucky collective beliefs. Second, it argues that collective epistemic luck is better explained in terms of groups lacking (suitably defined) forms of control over collective belief formation that are specific to the different procedures for forming collective beliefs. One of the main implications of this, we will argue, is that groups whose beliefs are formed via internal deliberation are more vulnerable to knowledge-undermining collective luck than groups that form their beliefs via non-deliberative methods, such as non-deliberative anonymous voting. The bottom line is that the greater exposure to knowledge-undermining luck that deliberation gives rise to provides a reason (not a conclusive one) for thinking that non-deliberative methods of group belief formation have greater epistemic value.","[Barba, Moises] Autonomous Univ Madrid, Madrid, Spain; [Broncano-Berrocal, Fernando] Univ Barcelona, LOGOS, Barcelona, Spain",Autonomous University of Madrid; University of Barcelona,"Broncano-Berrocal, F (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, LOGOS, Barcelona, Spain.",moises.barmag@gmail.com; f.broncano-berrocal@ub.edu,,"Broncano-Berrocal, Fernando/0000-0001-6472-2684; Barba, Moises/0000-0002-5959-0135",,,,,39,1,1,0,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0353-5150,1874-6349,,ACTA ANAL,Acta Anal.-Int.

While such theories are commonly advertised as affording particularly strong epistemic logics, they often make substantive assumptions about the background notion of normality and its logic. This article takes recent normality-based defences of the KK principle as a case study to submit such assumptions to scrutiny. After clarifying issues regarding the natural language use of normality claims, the article isolates a number of choice points regarding the role of contingency, context-sensitivity and similarity in our theorizing with normality. It turns out that both weaker and stronger logics of normality can be motivated depending on how such choices are resolved. And yet securing logics of normality strong enough for normality to play its envisaged role in epistemology may have unwelcome downstream consequences for the resultant theories of knowledge or justification.","[Loets, Annina J.] Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,"Loets, AJ (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Berlin, Germany.",annina.loets@hu-berlin.de,,"Loets, Annina/0000-0002-9343-1672",,,,,43,5,5,0,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0026-4423,1460-2113,,MIND,Mind,JAN,2022,131,521,,,,,159,191,,10.1093/mind/fzab021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mind/fzab021,,OCT 2021,33,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,YJ5DT,,hybrid,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000744553200006,View Full Record in Web of Science

We claim that B-INT exhibits a number of epistemic features implying the potential for certain epistemic problems, which, in turn, are likely to result in instances of epistemic injustice. To support this claim, we will first introduce and specify the terminology and technology behind B-INT. Second, we will present four fictitious scenarios of using B-INT and highlight a number of epistemic issues that might arise. Third, we will discuss their relation to the concept of epistemic justice, as well as potential instances thereof.

On this view, rather than knowledge itself constituting a mental state, when we know, we occupy a belief state that exhibits some additional non-mental characteristics. Fascinatingly, however, new empirical findings from cognitive neuroscience and experimental philosophy now offer direct, converging evidence that the brain can-and often does-treat knowledge as if it is a mental state in its own right. While some might be tempted to keep the metaphysics of epistemic states separate from the neurocognitive mechanics of our judgements about them, here I will argue that these empirical findings give us sufficient reason to conclude that knowledge is at least sometimes a mental state. The basis of this argument is the epistemological principle of neurocognitive parity-roughly, if the contents of a given judgement reflect the structure of knowledge, so do the neurocognitive mechanics that produced them. This principle, which I defend here, straightforwardly supports the inference from the empirical observation that the brain sometimes treats knowledge like a mental state to the epistemological conclusion that knowledge is at least sometimes a mental state. All told, the composite, belief-centric metaphysics of knowledge widely assumed in epistemology is almost certainly mistaken.","[Bricker, Adam Michael] Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Bricker, AM (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany.",adam.michael.bricker@gmail.com,,"Bricker, Adam/0000-0003-1509-3302",Sven Bernecker's Alexander von Humboldt Professor Grant,Sven Bernecker's Alexander von Humboldt Professor Grant,Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

How so? A couple of reasons are forthcoming in the literature. (1) Williamson (2000) argues that the E = K thesis (in contrast to internalism) provides the best explanation for the fact that scientists appear to argue from premises about true propositions (or facts) that are common knowledge among the members of the scientific community. (2) Kelly (Philosophy Compass, 3 (5), 933-955, 2008; 2016) argues that only externalism is suited to account for the public character of scientific evidence. In this article, I respond to Williamson and Kelly's arguments. First, I show that the E = K thesis isn't supported by the way in which we talk about scientific evidence, and that it is unable to account for facts about what has been regarded as scientific evidence and as justified scientific belief in the history of science. Second, I argue that there are internalist views that can account for the publicity of scientific evidence, and that those views indeed do better in that regard than the (externalist) view proposed by Kelly.

We can think of the traditional principles as simple but inaccurate approximations of the new proposals. Insofar as the old principles are intuitive and used in scientific and philosophical contexts, but are plausibly false, there's a real need to develop precise and correct formulations. These new renditions turned out to be more cautious, so they won't be able to do everything the old principled promised they could. For example, they respect closure for knowledge. But these sober formulations, or something like them, might be the best that we can do with respect to sensitivity. And there's value in understanding the limits to these types of principles.","[Pinillos, Angel] Arizona State Univ, POB 874302, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Pinillos, A (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, POB 874302, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",pinillos@asu.edu,,,,,,,37,3,3,0,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0031-8116,1573-0883,,PHILOS STUD,Philos.

Analyses of the reasoning found in the theorizations of certain seminal philosophers and leading scientists will reveal how the absence of the epistemic justification of reason defaults to the use of an unjustified form of reason that runs the play of an unrecognized and unchecked dialectic between epistemology and science. An alternative form of reason will be logically outlined and tested against the formalized skeptical critique in order for the newly recognized dialectic to be checked over reason with provisional epistemic justification. Zeno's paradox and Green's and Sellars' critique of givenness are employed as argument functionaries of the reasoned knowledge theory.,"[Dreyer, Verdie Michael] Vrije Univ Brussel, Rue Cesar Frank 32, Brussels, Ixelles, Belgium",Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Dreyer, VM (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Brussel, Rue Cesar Frank 32, Brussels, Ixelles, Belgium.",vdreyer@vub.be,,"Dreyer, Verdie/0000-0001-8278-8142",,,,,74,0,0,0,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-3893,1574-9274,,PHILOSOPHIA,Philosophia,APR,2022,50,2,,,,,503,532,,10.1007/s11406-021-00399-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11406-021-00399-3,,JUL 2021,30,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,0U6QZ,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000670138700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

If so, how much? Philosophers have recently argued for a wide range of answers to these questions, from the view that there is no progress whatsoever to the view that philosophy has provided answers to all the big philosophical questions. However, these views are difficult to compare and evaluate, because they rest on very different assumptions about the conditions under which philosophy would make progress. This paper looks to the comparatively mature debate about scientific progress for inspiration on how to formulate four distinct accounts of philosophical progress, in terms of truthlikeness, problem-solving, knowledge, and understanding. Equally importantly, the paper outlines a common framework for how to understand and evaluate these accounts. We distill a series of lessons from this exercise, to help pave the way for a more fruitful discussion about philosophical progress in the future.","[Dellsen, Finnur; Norton, James] Univ Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland; [Dellsen, Finnur] Inland Norway Univ Appl Sci, Hamar, Norway; [Lawler, Insa] Univ N Carolina, Greensboro, NC USA",University of Iceland; Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Greensboro,"Dellsén, F (corresponding author), Univ Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland.;Dellsén, F (corresponding author), Inland Norway Univ Appl Sci, Hamar, Norway.",fud@hi.is,,"Lawler, Insa/0000-0002-1250-6020; Norton, James/0000-0003-3029-1788; Dellsen, Finnur/0000-0003-4989-4204",Icelandic Centre for Research [195617-051],Icelandic Centre for Research,"Icelandic Centre for Research, Grant/Award Number: 195617-051",,98,14,14,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0029-4624,1468-0068,,NOUS,Nous,DEC,2022,56,4,,,,,814,840,,10.1111/nous.12383,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nous.12383,,JUN 2021,27,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,6Y8WM,,"hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-07-12,WOS:000667974500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The propensity interpretation brings a framework for describing the role of collective subjectivity in epistemic systems. This approach, as an acceptable epistemological stance, is related to the variability of anchored collective beliefs. The repetition and anchoring of subjective probabilistic beliefs becomes a relative reference frame for evaluating the elements of knowledge. With this in mind, each particular way of considering probability indicates a manner of distinguishing epistemic systems. In epistemic systems, the statements are collective points of view expressed in the form 'p is justified when belief in p is probably reliable.' The statements can be accurate in a particular epistemic system but inaccurate in other systems. As a result, by avoiding the 'all statements must be true or false' requirement, each proponent of a certain epistemic system can build a probabilistic picture of the world. In this picture, not every statement needs to be 'true' when and if the statement expresses a collective point of view that has a propensity to be reliable and justified.","[Kulikov, Sergey B.] Tomsk State Pedag Univ, Kievskaya St 60, Tomsk 634061, Russia",Tomsk State Pedagogical University,"Kulikov, SB (corresponding author), Tomsk State Pedag Univ, Kievskaya St 60, Tomsk 634061, Russia.",kulikov.sergh@gmail.com,"Kulikov, Sergey B./I-2683-2014","Kulikov, Sergey B./0000-0002-0913-9290",,,,,39,2,2,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1122-1151,1572-8390,,AXIOMATHES,Axiomathes,DEC,2022,32,6,,,,,1061,1079,,10.1007/s10516-021-09565-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10516-021-09565-4,,MAY 2021,19,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,7P3ZU,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000652975700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Many have also found it plausible that certain cases of proprioceptive knowledge, memorial knowledge, and self-evident knowledge are cases of knowledge that are not grounded in the possession of reasons. I refer to these as cases of basic knowledge. The existence of basic knowledge forms a primary objection to the idea that knowledge is a constitutively normative state. In what follows I offer a way through the apparent dilemma of having to choose between either basic knowledge or the normativity of knowledge. The solution involves homing in on a state of awareness (approximate to non-accidental true representation) that is distinct from knowledge and which in turn grounds the normativity of knowledge in a way that is fully consistent with the existence of basic knowledge. An upshot of this is that externalist theories of knowledge turn out to be fully compatible with the thesis that knowledgeable beliefs are always beliefs that are justified by the reasons one possesses.","[Silva, Paul, Jr.] Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Silva, P (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany.",psilvajr@gmail.com,,,Alexander von Humboldt Foundation,Alexander von Humboldt Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation),"This paper would not be what it is without the valuable contributions of two anonymous referees, Ram Neta, Peter Graham, Clayton Littlejohn, Sven Bernecker, Ori Beck, Joachim Horvath, Thomas Grundmann, Jessica Brown, Anna-Maria Asunta Eder, Daniel Greco, Andreas Mueller, Eyal Tal, Luis Rosa, Stefanie Grune, Sofia Bokros, Giulia Napolitano, Lisa Benossi, Francesco Praolini, Jakob Ohlhorst, Errol Lord, Lisa Miracchi, and Dan Singer.

The paper commences by discussing the implications of the traditional epistemological view of knowledge as justified true belief for mathematics education and uses this to build a preliminary description of knowledge building. Ideas from critical realism are then used to show that it is not so much the content of knowledge that matters but the production of knowledge and to build an enhanced conception of knowledge building in school mathematics. A distinction is made between knowledge and knowing that provides a non-relativist yet fallible view of knowledge, recognising its emergent but directed nature through its production and legitimation within established fields. The importance of knowledge building as a democratic right is then discussed, highlighting the importance of specialised knowledge and arguing that knowledge differentiation provides a basis for a conception of school mathematics curriculum that is dynamic and empowering. The paper concludes by discussing a range of potential theoretical and empirical research projects arising from a focus on knowledge and knowledge building in school mathematics.","[Thornton, Steve] Charles Sturt Univ, Albury, NSW, Australia",Charles Sturt University,"Thornton, S (corresponding author), Charles Sturt Univ, Albury, NSW, Australia.",stevethornton18@gmail.com,,,,,,,53,1,1,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1033-2170,2211-050X,,MATH EDUC RES J,Math.

Many of these systems, for instance, deep learning-based applications using multilayered Artificial Neural Nets, exhibit epistemic opacity in the sense that they preclude comprehensive human understanding. In consequence, voices from industry, policymakers, and research have suggested trust as an attitude for engaging with clinical AI systems. Yet, in the philosophical and ethical literature on medical AI, the notion of trust remains fiercely debated. Trust skeptics hold that talking about trust in nonhuman agents constitutes a category error and worry about the concept being misused for ethics washing. Proponents of trust have responded to these worries from various angles, disentangling different concepts and aspects of trust in AI, potentially organized in layers or dimensions. Given the substantial disagreements across these accounts of trust and the important worries about ethics washing, we embrace a diverging strategy here. Instead of aiming for a positive definition of the elements and nature of trust in AI, we proceed ex negativo, that is we look at cases where trust or distrust are misplaced. Comparing these instances with trust expedited in doctor-patient relationships, we systematize these instances and propose a taxonomy of both misplaced trust and distrust. By inverting the perspective and focusing on negative examples, we develop an account that provides useful ethical constraints for decisions in clinical as well as regulatory contexts and that highlights how we should not engage with medical AI.","[Starke, Georg; Ienca, Marcello] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Coll Humanities, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne,"Ienca, M (corresponding author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Coll Humanities, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",marcello.ienca@epfl.ch,,"Ienca, Marcello/0000-0001-8835-5444; Starke, Georg/0000-0001-7428-2619",ERA-NET NEURON project HYBRIDMIND (Swiss National Science Foundation) [32NE30_199436]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [32NE30_199436] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF),ERA-NET NEURON project HYBRIDMIND (Swiss National Science Foundation)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),This work has been supported by the ERA-NET NEURON project HYBRIDMIND (Swiss National Science Foundation 32NE30_199436).,,51,8,8,3,19,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0963-1801,1469-2147,,CAMB Q HEALTHC ETHIC,Camb.

Since the folk concept of truth allows accidental truths, the deflationary theory of truth will face a serious problem. In particular, it follows that the deflationist schema fails to capture the proper extension of truth by precluding accidental truths of utterances. Even though the argument uses cases in the context-shifting argument, this conclusion does not require so much as the truth of contextualism, but only two assumptions, the existence of context-relative non-literal contents of utterances (or speech acts), and the existence of accidental truths, both of which are widely accepted by folks and theorists. We will also consider various responses to the argument, including a revisionary deflationist position, all of which we argue are unsatisfactory or committed to a highly implausible view.","[Mizumoto, Masaharu] Japan Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Knowledge Sci, 1-1 Asahidai, Nomi, Ishikawa 9231292, Japan",Japan Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (JAIST),"Mizumoto, M (corresponding author), Japan Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Knowledge Sci, 1-1 Asahidai, Nomi, Ishikawa 9231292, Japan.",mizumoto@jaist.ac.jp,,,JSPS [18K00010],"JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science)",This work was supported by JSPS: [Grant Number 18K00010].,,38,2,2,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0020-174X,1502-3923,,INQUIRY,Inquiry-Interdiscip.

A dialectical hypothesis,INQUIRY-AN INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY,,,English,Article; Early Access,,,,,,Metaphilosophy; method of cases; arguments; justifying; being justified,INTUITIONS,"The method of cases (MOC), as standardly construed, involves an evidential appeal to intuitions. Philosophers, however, often argue for their case verdicts, they offer reasons for accepting their truth. According to Max Deutsch and Herman Cappelen - whose ground-breaking case studies first drew attention to this underappreciated phenomenon - their reason-giving would constitute compelling evidence that, contrary to the received view, philosophers relying on MOC regard arguments, not intuitions, as their main justificatory source. This explanatory hypothesis has met with substantial resistance among metaphilosophers. The main goal of this paper is to broaden the theoretical playing field by considering a yet unexplored alternative hypothesis. I argue that said phenomenon in fact admits of an alternative, intuition-friendly explanation in light of a fundamental distinction in justification theory which has been entirely overlooked by the current debate - i.e. the one between justifying a belief and being justified in holding it. This distinction, I suggest, allows one to naturally construe philosophers' justifying activity as a dialectically motivated kind of proactive reasoning geared toward the goal of maximizing consensus over their verdicts. Once thus construed, it remains compatible with philosophers thinking of intuitions as the main source of their justification.","[Angelucci, Adriano] Univ Urbino, Dept Pure & Appl Sci, Urbino, Italy",University of Urbino,"Angelucci, A (corresponding author), Univ Urbino, Dept Pure & Appl Sci, Urbino, Italy.",adriano.angelucci@uniurb.it,,,,,,,52,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0020-174X,1502-3923,,INQUIRY,Inquiry-Interdiscip.

I show how incorporating the interpretative procedure to the reconstruction of a certain kind of thought experiments, i.e., the method of cases, provides a solution to the so-called problem of deviant realizations. According to this problem it is hard to formulate the logical structure of the method of cases that excludes far-fetched interpretations of a particular thought experiment's description that are inconsistent with the expected conclusion of the experiment. As I show, if we agree that the interpretative procedure precedes the act of establishing whether the thing which is at issue (e.g., knowledge) appears within a certain state of affairs, deviant realizations could be ruled out, since within interpretative procedure we establish the set of states of affairs that are compatible with the intentions of the author of the thought experiment.

In this paper, I will first clarify and elaborate the mischaracterization objection, explain its metaphilosophical significance, and then argue that all extant replies to it fail.

Our aim in this essay is to make some progress toward dissolving this alleged paradox by exploring the relationship between disability and various goods of life-that is, components of a life that typically make a person's life go better for them. We focus on four widely recognized goods of life (happiness, rewarding relationships, knowledge, achievement) and four common types of disability (sensory mobility, intellectual, and social) and systematically examine the extent to which the four disability types are in principle compatible with obtaining the four goods of life. Our findings suggest that there is a high degree of compatibility. This undermines the widespread view that disabilities, by their very nature, substantially limit a person ;s ability to access the goods of life, and it provides some guidance on how to dissolve the Disability Paradox.","[Campbell, Stephen M.] Bentley Univ, Waltham, MA 02452 USA; [Nyholm, Sven] Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Walter, Jennifer K.] Univ Penn, Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Bentley University; Utrecht University; University of Pennsylvania,"Campbell, SM (corresponding author), Bentley Univ, Dept Philosophy, 175 Forest St, Waltham, MA 02452 USA.",scampbell@bentley.edu,,,"National Heart, Lung, And Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health [K23HL141700]","National Heart, Lung, And Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI))","We are very grateful to Dan Haybron and Richard Kim (the editors of this special issue), Gwen Bradford, Teresa Blankmeyer Burke, Caroline Harnacke, Steven Joffe, Eva Kittay, Tina Rulli, Joseph Stramondo, Rosa Terlazzo, Dominic Wilkinson, the audience at the 2017 Tennessee Value and Agency conference on Philosophy of Disability, and our reviewers at the Journal of Medicine and Philosophy, all of whom provided helpful feedback on portions or full drafts of this essay.

Since it is often formulated as a conceptual analysis problem, it has also turned into a significant metaphilosophical problem. Thus, today, in the context of the Gettier problem, contemporary analytic philosophy is witnessing three crises or issues of debate: one is a crisis within epistemology, the other is the crisis of methodological justification, and the other is the crisis of the identity of analytical philosophy. In this study, two views are defended regarding these debates. First, contrary to widespread assumption, the Gettier problem is not a conceptual analysis problem. This widespread assumption is a mistake caused by not interpreting the development of analytic philosophy correctly. Secondly, the method that originates the Gettier problem is nothing but the continuation of the ordinary language philosophy approach, which proposes that propositions containing knows, knowledge, belief' and related words be subjected to linguistic analysis. However, just as Karl Popper warned long ago, the main difficulty in applying the ordinary language philosophy approach to epistemological problems is that it leads to a deviation from the main topic of epistemology.","[Ozturk, Ali Bilge] Akdeniz Univ, Antalya, Turkey",Akdeniz University,"Öztürk, AB (corresponding author), Akdeniz Univ, Edebiyat Fak, Felsefe Bolumu, TR-07058 Antalya, Turkey.",alibilgeorturk@akdeniz.edu.tr,,,,,,,42,0,0,0,1,BEYTULHIKME FELSEFE CEVRESI,ANKARA,"ASAGI OVECLER MAH, 1307 SOK NO 4-2, CANKAYA, ANKARA, 06460, Turkiye",1303-8303,,,BEYTULHIKME,Beytulhikme,DEC,2021,11,4,,,,,1409,1444,,10.18491/beytulhikme.1841,http://dx.doi.org/10.18491/beytulhikme.1841,,,36,Philosophy,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Philosophy,YI8RQ,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000744110500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

We will adopt an epistemological and embodied perspective to propose a definition for both terms. Then, we will maintain that, while willful ignorance is involved in irrational patterns of reasoning and beliefs, knowledge avoidance should be considered epistemically rational under particular circumstances. We will begin our analysis by considering which of the two phenomena is involved in patterns of reasoning that are still amply recognized as irrational-as wishful thinking, self-deception, and akrasia. We will then discuss the impact of epistemic feelings-which are emotional events that depend on epistemic states-on agents' decision-making. Then, we will consider the impact of willful ignorance and knowledge avoidance on agents' autonomy. By considering these issues, we will argue that when agents are aware that they are avoiding certain information (and aware of what kind of feelings acquiring the information would trigger), knowledge avoidance should be considered a rational, autonomy-increasing, hope-depended selection of information.","[Arfini, Selene; Magnani, Lorenzo] Univ Pavia, Dept Human, Computat Philosophy Lab, Philosophy Sect, Pavia, Italy",University of Pavia,"Arfini, S (corresponding author), Univ Pavia, Dept Human, Computat Philosophy Lab, Philosophy Sect, Pavia, Italy.",selene.arfini@unipv.it,"Arfini, Selene/AAP-1675-2020","Arfini, Selene/0000-0001-5499-8644",,,,,67,3,3,0,22,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

Representations of knowledge, by contrast, have received comparatively little attention and have often been understood as depending on prior representations of belief. After all, how could one represent someone as knowing something if one does not even represent them as believing it? Drawing on a wide range of methods across cognitive science, we ask whether belief or knowledge is the more basic kind of representation. The evidence indicates that nonhuman primates attribute knowledge but not belief, that knowledge representations arise earlier in human development than belief representations, that the capacity to represent knowledge may remain intact in patient populations even when belief representation is disrupted, that knowledge (but not belief) attributions are likely automatic, and that explicit knowledge attributions are made more quickly than equivalent belief attributions. Critically, the theory of mind representations uncovered by these various methods exhibits a set of signature features clearly indicative of knowledge: they are not modality-specific, they are factive, they are not just true belief, and they allow for representations of egocentric ignorance. We argue that these signature features elucidate the primary function of knowledge representation: facilitating learning from others about the external world. This suggests a new way of understanding theory of mind - one that is focused on understanding others' minds in relation to the actual world, rather than independent from it.","[Phillips, Jonathan] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Program Cognit Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Phillips, Jonathan] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Philosophy, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Buckwalter, Wesley] George Mason Univ, Inst Philosophy & Publ Policy, Dept Philosophy, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Cushman, Fiery] Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Friedman, Ori] Univ Waterloo, Dept Psychol, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Martin, Alia] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Psychol, Wellington 6012, New Zealand; [Turri, John] Univ Waterloo, Philosophy Dept, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Turri, John] Univ Waterloo, Cognit Sci Program, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Santos, Laurie] Yale Univ, Dept Psychol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Knobe, Joshua] Yale Univ, Dept Philosophy, Program Cognit Sci, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Dartmouth College; Dartmouth College; George Mason University; Harvard University; University of Waterloo; Victoria University Wellington; University of Waterloo; University of Waterloo; Yale University; Yale University,"Phillips, J (corresponding author), Dartmouth Coll, Dept Psychol & Brain Sci, Program Cognit Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.;Phillips, J (corresponding author), Dartmouth Coll, Dept Philosophy, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.",jonathan.s.phillips@dartmouth.edu; wesleybuckwalter@gmail.com; friedman@uwaterloo.ca; alia.martin@vuw.ac.nz; john.turri@gmail.com; laurie.santos@yale.edu; joshua.knobe@yale.edu,"Phillips, Jonathan Scott/GYE-2506-2022; Friedman, Ori/K-5429-2012","Phillips, Jonathan Scott/0000-0002-9536-1794; Friedman, Ori/0000-0003-2346-9787",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [SSHRC: 435-2015-0598]; Canada Research Chairs Program [CRC: 950-231217],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Canada Research Chairs Program(Canada Research Chairs),This research was supported in part by funding to JT by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC: 435-2015-0598) and the Canada Research Chairs Program (CRC: 950-231217).,,232,37,40,2,28,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0140-525X,1469-1825,,BEHAV BRAIN SCI,Behav.

The second approach aims to show that there are factive mental states that to Williamson count as cases of knowing, but nonetheless fail to entail a corresponding belief.

Second, the externalist approach which demands the verification of objective validity of revelatory truth. Third, the inclusivist approach which seeks the scientificity of theology from a hermeneutic perspective. Outlining the crucial points and limits of these approaches and replacing the question about theology as science with a theological reexamination of the possibility of science in general, this paper tries to suggest an alternative approach by establishing the possibility of scientific knowledge in general from the trinitarian perspective. Under this reformulation of the question, the philosophy of science set forth by Fichte as the most rigorous model of theory of science is critically explored.

The paper highlights how the dilemma facing virtue-theoretic analyses of knowledge is more general than these critics seem to suggest. It then elucidates the worry that the threat facing virtue epistemology is really a dilemma between Gettier counterexamples and radical skepticism. Finally, the paper considers how some recent virtue epistemologists have tried to viably defuse the Gettier problem. It shows (i) just how the critiques it elucidates have (mis)shaped the dialectic between virtue epistemology and what is required in solving Gettier counterexamples and (ii) how this has led to virtue epistemologists underestimating the widespread insidiousness of Gettier counterexamples.","[Church, Ian M.] Hillsdale Coll, 33 E Coll St, Hillsdale, MI 49242 USA",Hillsdale College,"Church, IM (corresponding author), Hillsdale Coll, 33 E Coll St, Hillsdale, MI 49242 USA.",ichurch@hillsdale.edu,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1068,1467-9973,,METAPHILOSOPHY,Metaphilosophy,OCT,2021,52,5,,,,,681,695,,10.1111/meta.12518,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/meta.12518,,OCT 2021,15,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,XA5UJ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000705030100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

But the law also has features which haven't stirred much in the way of philosophical investigation. I must say that I find this surprising. For the fact is that a well-run criminal trial is a master-class in logic and epistemology. Below I examine the logical and epistemological properties of greatest operational involvement in a criminal proceedings, concepts such as evidence, proof, argument, inference, relevance, probability, and more. My principal objective is to expose the deep cleavage between establishment norms in epistemology and logic and standard practice in criminal proceedings. This gives us two options to reflect upon. In one, the establishment norms for the correct management of the concepts in question are basically sound. In that case, as I will show, common law criminal practice would be basically unsound; its convictions would be basically false and unjust. Seen from the other perspective, the criminal justice system would be basically sound, and its criminal convictions basically true and just. It turns out to matter that option one meets with widely spread common disbelief and is generally taken as contrary to common knowledge. What is needed here is an epistemology which gives these sentiments some air to breathe. I will argue that on balance it is the logico-epistemic establishment which requires some serious rethinking.","[Woods, John] Univ British Columbia, Dept Philosophy, Abduct Syst Grp, 1866 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Woods, J (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Philosophy, Abduct Syst Grp, 1866 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada.",john.woods@ubc.ca,,,,,,,60,1,1,0,12,SPRINGER BASEL AG,BASEL,"PICASSOPLATZ 4, BASEL, 4052, SWITZERLAND",1661-8297,1661-8300,,LOG UNIVERSALIS,Log Universalis,DEC,2021,15,4,,,,,399,433,,10.1007/s11787-021-00289-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11787-021-00289-y,,SEP 2021,35,Logic,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics,XM1IX,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000702192600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

I will attempt to make sense of the nominal appeal (an approach that conserves the process of continuing belief through evidence and conceptualization) to both of these ideas in a sophisticated manner. The linguistic form of using words seems allied to the context sensitivity of the speakers involved in social practices. A tripartite structure pivots the model of linguistic belief, where minds are causally entrenched in a world that stimulates conceptual or internal states, representing how objectivity works.

We argue that one can legitimately answer positively or negatively, depending on whether or not one's true belief is justified by what we call adequate reasons. To facilitate our argument we introduce a simple propositional logic of reason-based belief, and give an axiomatic characterization of the notion of adequacy for reasons. We show that this logic is sufficiently flexible to accommodate various useful features, including quantification over reasons. We use our framework to contrast two notions of JTB: one internalist, the other externalist. We argue that Gettier cases essentially challenge the internalist notion but not the externalist one. Our approach commits us to a form of infallibilism about knowledge, but it also leaves us with a puzzle, namely whether knowledge involves the possession of only adequate reasons, or leaves room for some inadequate reasons.

I illustrate these features with historical examples of normatively-different outcomes driven by institutional structure rather, holding fixed characteristics of agents' motivations. I then defend the view from reductionist objections.","[Sankaran, Kirun] Univ N Carolina, Dept Philosophy, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Sankaran, K (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Philosophy, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA.",kirun@email.unc.edu,,"Sankaran, Kirun/0000-0003-4293-6299",,,,,99,1,2,1,3,BRILL,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",1740-4681,1745-5243,,J MORAL PHILOS,J.

While the prospects for connecting the concept of epistemic anxiety to the two most prominent accounts of intellectual virtue, i.e., virtue-reliabilism and virtue-responsibilism, are promising, I primarily focus on whether the capacity for epistemic anxiety counts as an intellectual virtue in the reliabilist sense. As I argue, there is a close yet unexplored connection between feelings of epistemic anxiety and the form of inference commonly known as Inference to the Best Explanation (IBE). Specifically, I argue that both the recognition that some fact requires an explanation-a necessary first step in applying IBE-and the subsequent motivation to employ IBE are typically facilitated by feelings of epistemic anxiety. So, provided IBE is truth-conducive the capacity for epistemic anxiety should count as an intellectual virtue in the reliabilist sense. After outlining my main argument, I address the challenge that the capacity for epistemic anxiety has the potential to be misleading. To respond to this challenge, I discuss how our recognition that a fact requires an explanation must in part be a species of practical knowledge, rather than theoretical knowledge. For the agent to skillfully distinguish between facts that require an explanation and facts that do not, she must develop the virtuous disposition to feel the appropriate amount of epistemic anxiety. Despite the many negative aspects associated with anxiety, as I conclude, being disposed to feel the appropriate amount of epistemic anxiety is ultimately good for us.","[Cabrera, Frank] Milwaukee Sch Engn, Humanities Social Sci & Commun Dept, Milwaukee, WI 53202 USA",Milwaukee School Engineering,"Cabrera, F (corresponding author), Milwaukee Sch Engn, Humanities Social Sci & Commun Dept, Milwaukee, WI 53202 USA.",cabrera@msoe.edu,,,,,,,99,1,1,0,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0039-7857,1573-0964,,SYNTHESE,Synthese,DEC,2021,199,5-6,,,,,13471,13495,,10.1007/s11229-021-03383-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11229-021-03383-2,,AUG 2021,25,History & Philosophy Of Science; Philosophy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),History & Philosophy of Science; Philosophy,YC8IE,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000691175900007,View Full Record in Web of Science

On the Peircean view, propositions are sign substitutes, or representamens. In typical cases of thought about the world, propositions represent facts. In each of Gettier's examples, we have a case in which a person S believes some proposition p, there is some fact F* such that were p to represent F* to S then p would be true, and yet p does not represent F* to S but some other fact F of which p is false. Since truth is a property of propositions with respect to their representational function, it follows that the belief is not true. Although an examination of Gettier's two cases, this essay is not a defense of the justified true belief (JTB) analysis of knowledge, for there are objections to the JTB analysis other than Gettier's two cases.

This closure principle of epistemic justification can be happily thought of as a multi-premise closure principle and it cannot be used in Cartesian skeptical arguments that employ a closure principle of epistemic justification. In this way, then, it represents marked improvement over other contemporary closure principles of epistemic justification that require both sacrificing multi-premise closure and forcing anti-Cartesian skeptics who reject the closure principle employed in certain Cartesian skeptical arguments to cast aside justification closure.","[Simpson, James] Univ Florida, Dept Philosophy, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Simpson, J (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Philosophy, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",simpson.james@ufl.edu,,,,,,,63,0,0,1,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0039-7857,1573-0964,,SYNTHESE,Synthese,DEC,2021,199,5-6,,,,,12331,12361,,10.1007/s11229-021-03335-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11229-021-03335-w,,AUG 2021,31,History & Philosophy Of Science; Philosophy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),History & Philosophy of Science; Philosophy,YC8IE,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000683635600003,View Full Record in Web of Science

An important challenge facing MOOCs is the teacher bandwidth problem: in the MOOC environment, where there are potentially hundreds of thousands of students, it is impossible for a few teachers to interact with individual students - in other words, there is not enough teacher bandwidth. According to George Siemens and Stephen Downes's theory of connectivism, one can make up for the lack of teacher bandwidth by relying on collaboration between students. Philosophically speaking, however, this theory is underdeveloped. In this paper, Ben Kotzee and S. Orestis Palermos consider the question of learner collaboration in online courses, and the theory of connectivism, from the perspective of social epistemology. They note the similarities between Siemens and Downes's theory and virtue reliabilist theories of epistemic collaboration more broadly. The paper has two main aims: first, to offer an illustration of how it is possible to conceptualize learner collaboration in online settings as analogous to collaboration between scientists; and second, to expand on and clarify what Siemens and Downes had in mind when they proposed the theory of connectivism.","[Kotzee, Ben] Univ Birmingham, Sch Educ, Philosophy Educ, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Palermos, S.

This analysis is based both on the legal-theoretical framework defined by the justification of the restriction of the maxim, and on a discussion of some paradigmatic Italian cases where the standard of excusability involving inevitable ignorance is applied. The analysis reveals that the notion of inevitable ignorance is closely connected to a number of notions also used in formal epistemology, such as belief, evidence, rationality, and trust.","[Ciuni, Roberto] Univ Padua, Sez Filosofia, Dipartimento FISPPA, Piazza Capitaniato 3, I-35139 Padua, Italy; [Tuzet, Giovanni] Univ Commerciale Luigi Bocconi, Dipartimento Studi Giurid A Sraffa, Via Rontgen 1, Milan, Italy",University of Padua; Bocconi University,"Ciuni, R (corresponding author), Univ Padua, Sez Filosofia, Dipartimento FISPPA, Piazza Capitaniato 3, I-35139 Padua, Italy.",roberto.ciuni@unipd.it; giovanni.tuzet@unibocconi.it,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0039-7857,1573-0964,,SYNTHESE,Synthese,JUN,2021,198,6,,,,,5047,5066,,10.1007/s11229-019-02388-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11229-019-02388-2,,,20,History & Philosophy Of Science; Philosophy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),History & Philosophy of Science; Philosophy,SM7PB,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000657791400006,View Full Record in Web of Science

The core of the proposed interpretation is that the method of cases consists of two steps (the case description and the target argument) and that the case description does not elicit judgments about the applicability of the concepts in question. In fact, case descriptions do not elicit anything at all; rather, they show some facts, usually some factual distinctions among relevant situations.

Recent empirical studies have shown that the inclination toward this intuitive judgment is shared among people, which seems to reinforce the argument against the PAP. However, some scholars have argued for Descriptive Anti-Intuitionism (DAI) - intuitive judgments have never played an evidential role in philosophy - and thus denied the philosophical significance of such empirical findings. I point out that although DAI fails in its literal claim for FSCs, an associated insight remains potent: an intuitive judgment is so fragile that it can be easily defeated by further arguments. Nevertheless, I argue, empirical studies are significant in uncovering the general principles to which we are committed in our practice concerning moral responsibility.

J,"Huneman, P; Troubé, S; Douville, O",,,,"Huneman, Philippe; Troube, Sarah; Douville, Olivier",,,The extensions of the post-truth: Epistemological and political questions. Interview with Philippe Huneman,EVOLUTION PSYCHIATRIQUE,,,French,Article,,,,,,Conspiracy theory; Post-truth; Belief; Epistemology; Rationality; Democracy,,"Objectives. - What is the logic of assent given to a conspiracy theory? Is the post-truth era to be understood as a quest for certainty, or on the contrary as the unleashing of doubt? Such questions deserve to be apprehended through a psychological approach to conspiracy, in order to clarify the meaning and equivocity of the terms belief, truth, assertive logic, and doubt. This conceptual clarification cannot take place without examining the use of these notions in the epistemology of knowledge and in the philosophy of science. Method. - Sarah Troube and Olivier Douville interviewed the philosopher of science Philippe Huneman about his recent work on conspiracy theories and the conditions of the production and the diffusion of scientific knowledge. Results. - The interview invites us to question the surface analogy between the rapid modes of construction of conspiracy theories and the process of the constitution of scientific knowledge. It should be taken into account that this outpouring of post-truths offers us the opportunity to question the criteria of rational doubt and justified belief. The difficulty of establishing a priori criteria that would make it possible to separate - from the sole examination of individual belief - the rational and irrational uses of doubt and belief leads us to examine the conditions of the social production of knowledge. Discussion. - Reducing adherence to conspiracy theories to an individual belief in the truth of these theories leads to a misunderstanding of the phenomenon under consideration. Acknowledging the epistemic equivocity of belief allows us to re-situate it in its social and interlocutory dimension of address to the other. The question of the social production of knowledge, and more particularly of scientific knowledge, invites us to question the processes that legitimize the assent of the public and researchers in the reliability of scientific knowledge. But it also allows us to identify, in the current social and economic conditions of research, the elements likely to engender a form of mistrust towards certain scientific productions. Conclusion. - The impossibility of confining oneself to an examination of belief as an individual phenomenon, and of separating a priori the irrational from the rational in the conspiratorial phenomenon, leads to epistemological and political reflection. By introducing, in public debate, an indifference to any division between true and false, the proliferation of fake news not only attacks the very conditions of the constitution of shared knowledge, but also jeopardizes the springs of democratic deliberation. Contrary to any filiation between the post-truth era and post-modernist philosophies, the understanding of this indifference to true and false is to be placed in the context of an information market that creates the conditions for this lack of differentiation between true and false facts.

We can then ask: Do this failure imply that a definitional characterization of the concept of God is equally untenable? My central purpose in this article is to answer that question. My emphasis is representational. I plan to analyze the extent to which the most important problems raised against the classical theory of concepts affect a definitional-representational approach to the concept of God. As a result of this effort, I show that the criticisms against the classical theory that threaten such an approach depend on the plurality characteristic of the interreligious context, which in its turn creates other problems.","[Silvestre, Ricardo Souza] Univ Fed Campina Grande, Dept Filosofia, Campina Grande, Paraiba, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Campina Grande,"Silvestre, RS (corresponding author), Univ Fed Campina Grande, Dept Filosofia, Campina Grande, Paraiba, Brazil.",doss@ufcg.edu.br,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,0,UNIV DO VALE DO RIO DOS SINOS,SAO LEOPOLDO,"AV UNISINOS 950 CP 275, SAO LEOPOLDO, RS 93001-970, BRAZIL",1519-5023,1984-8234,,FILOS UNISINOS,Filos.

I focus on the conceptions about natural kinds. Since natural kind terms are a crucial part of the discourse of the natural sciences, my conclusions are particularly relevant in science education. To perform my analysis, I use a thought experiment, adapted from Hilary Putnam's famous Twin-Earth examples. I conclude that, to avoid some strong ontoepistemic implications, an externalist view of the learner's thought must be adopted. In my approach, students' conceptions are re-interpreted in terms of Hilary Putnam's stereotypes, conventional representations of a natural kind that guarantee a semantic competence in a specific linguistic environment. As a conclusion, I argue that the role of students' conceptions is not epistemic but pragmatic. They should not be understood as a partial or provisional representation of how a natural kind really is but as linguistic tools that permit the learner to engage in classroom discourse. Finally, I present a preliminary application of my ideas to the study of the usage of tautologies in science education.","[Sanchez Gomez, Pedro J.] Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Didact Ciencias Expt Sociales & Matemat, Fac Educ, C Rector Royo Villanova S-N, Madrid 28040, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"Gómez, PJS (corresponding author), Univ Complutense Madrid, Dept Didact Ciencias Expt Sociales & Matemat, Fac Educ, C Rector Royo Villanova S-N, Madrid 28040, Spain.",pedros@ucm.es,,,"Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades [PGC2018-099423-B-I00]","Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades","This work has been supported by the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades, through the research project PGC2018-099423-B-I00.

J,"Schlenker, P",,,,"Schlenker, Philippe",,,Triggering Presuppositions,GLOSSA-A JOURNAL OF GENERAL LINGUISTICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,presuppositions; triggering problem; dynamic semantics; epistemic preconditions; projection problem; local contexts,LINGUISTIC INFERENCES,"While presuppositions are often thought to be lexically encoded, researchers have repeatedly argued for `triggering algorithms' that productively classify certain entailments as presuppositions. We provide new evidence for this position and sketch a novel triggering rule. On the empirical side, we show that presuppositions are productively generated from iconic expressions (such as gestures) that one may not have seen before, which suggests that a triggering algorithm is indeed called for. Turning to normal words, we show that sometimes a presupposition p is triggered by a simple or complex expression that does not even entail p: it is only when contextual information guarantees that the entailment goes through that the presupposition emerges. On standard theories, this presupposition could not be hardwired, because if so it should make itself felt (by way of projection or accommodation) in all cases. Rather, a triggering algorithm seems to take as an input a contextual meaning, and to turn some contextual entailments into presuppositions. On the theoretical side, we propose that an entailment q (possibly a contextual one) of an expression qq' is treated as a presupposition if q is an epistemic precondition of the global meaning, in the following sense: usually, when one learns that qq' (e.g. x stops q-ing), one antecedently knows that q (e.g. x q-ed). Presuppositions thus arise from an attempt to ensure that information that is cognitively inert in general experience is also trivial relative to its linguistic environment. On various analyses, q is trivial in its linguistic environment just in case q is entailed by its local context; this provides a direct link between presupposition generation and presupposition projection. (An appendix discusses the relation between this proposal and an alternative one in terms of entailments that are in some sense counterfactually stable.)","[Schlenker, Philippe] Ecole Normale Super, Dept Etud Cognit, Inst Jean Nicod ENS EHESS CNRS, Paris, France; [Schlenker, Philippe] PSL Res Univ, Paris, France; [Schlenker, Philippe] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA",Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite PSL; New York University,"Schlenker, P (corresponding author), Ecole Normale Super, Dept Etud Cognit, Inst Jean Nicod ENS EHESS CNRS, Paris, France.;Schlenker, P (corresponding author), PSL Res Univ, Paris, France.;Schlenker, P (corresponding author), NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA.",philippe.schlenker@gmail.com,,"Schlenker, Philippe/0000-0001-9489-9325","European Research Council, ERC [788077]; [ANR-17-EURE-0017]; European Research Council (ERC) [788077] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)","European Research Council, ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); ; European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government)","The research leading to these results received funding from the European Research Council, ERC Grant Agreement No 788077-Orisem (PI: Schlenker).

In this paper, I argue that it has proved difficult to provide a satisfying answer to this question. I also argue that this difficulty is predicted by recent work in knowledge-first epistemology. I think this shows that recent work in epistemology has important implications for practice in the philosophy of science. It is therefore worth paying closer attention in the philosophy of science to this recent work in knowledge-first epistemology.","[Wilde, Michael] Univ Kent, Dept Philosophy, Canterbury CT2 7NF, Kent, England",University of Kent,"Wilde, M (corresponding author), Univ Kent, Dept Philosophy, Canterbury CT2 7NF, Kent, England.",m.e.wilde@kent.ac.uk,,,Arts and Humanities Research Council [AH/M005917/1]; AHRC [AH/M005917/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Arts and Humanities Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)); AHRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),"Arts and Humanities Research Council, Evaluating Evidence in Medicine, AH/M005917/1.",,36,4,4,1,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0039-7857,1573-0964,,SYNTHESE,Synthese,DEC,2021,199,3-4,,,,,6103,6118,,10.1007/s11229-021-03062-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11229-021-03062-2,,FEB 2021,16,History & Philosophy Of Science; Philosophy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),History & Philosophy of Science; Philosophy,ZB0NV,,hybrid,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000619750400002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Standard models of conversation hold that language production and comprehension are guided by constant, rapid inferences about what other agents have in mind. However, the idea that mindreading is a pervasive feature of conversation is challenged by a large body of evidence suggesting that mental state attribution is slow and taxing, at least when it deals with propositional attitudes such as beliefs. Belief attributions involve contents that are decoupled from our own primary representation of reality; handling these contents has come to be seen as the signature of full-blown human mindreading. However, mindreading in cooperative communication does not necessarily demand decoupling. We argue for a theoretical and empirical turn towards ?factive? forms of mentalizing here. In factive mentalizing, we monitor what others do or do not know, without generating decoupled representations. We propose a model of the representational, cognitive, and interactive components of factive mentalizing, a model that aims to explain efficient real-time monitoring of epistemic states in conversation. After laying out this account, we articulate a more limited set of conversational functions for nonfactive forms of mentalizing, including contexts of meta-linguistic repair, deception, and argumentation. We conclude with suggestions for further research into the roles played by factive versus nonfactive forms of mentalizing in conversation.","[Westra, Evan] York Univ, Dept Philosophy, S448 Ross Bldg,4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada; [Nagel, Jennifer] Univ Toronto, Dept Philosophy, Toronto, ON, Canada",York University - Canada; University of Toronto,"Westra, E (corresponding author), York Univ, Dept Philosophy, S448 Ross Bldg,4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.",ewestra@yorku.ca,"Nagel, Jennifer/IUQ-1707-2023; Nagel, Jennifer/G-5394-2013","Nagel, Jennifer/0000-0002-0960-0497","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council [435-2017-1041, 756-2018-0012]; Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society,"This research was supported by Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council Postdoctoral Fellowship #756-2018-0012, Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council Insight Grant #435-20171041, and the Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society.

Accordingly, whenever a claim is objectively true, its truth conditions ought not depend upon the context in which it is uttered or the utterer making the claim. Part of our ongoing empirical studies surveying people's responses to questions about truth involved prompts on objectivity. Our studies suggest the following: (1) overall, individuals tend to endorse claims that are consistent with the objectivity of truth; (2) not all conceptions of objectivity are equal, even people who endorse the objectivity of truth sometimes assent to one form of truth's objectivity over other forms; (3) philosophers and non-philosophers both endorse the objectivity of truth, but the apparent commitment of philosophers is stronger.","[Barnard, Robert] Univ Mississippi, Bryant Hall 101, University, MS 38677 USA; [Ulatowski, Joseph] Univ Waikato, Postal Bag 3105,Gate 1,Knighton Rd, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand",University of Mississippi; University of Waikato,"Ulatowski, J (corresponding author), Univ Waikato, Postal Bag 3105,Gate 1,Knighton Rd, Hamilton 3240, New Zealand.",rwbjr@olemiss.edu; julatows@waikato.ac.nz,"Barnard, Robert/KIK-6292-2024; Ulatowski, Joseph/C-7379-2016","Ulatowski, Joseph/0000-0003-3019-1269",,,,,48,7,7,0,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0039-7857,1573-0964,,SYNTHESE,Synthese,FEB,2021,198,SUPPL 2,,2,SI,,717,733,,10.1007/s11229-017-1605-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11229-017-1605-7,,,17,History & Philosophy Of Science; Philosophy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),History & Philosophy of Science; Philosophy,QF2XV,,Green Submitted,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000616763900006,View Full Record in Web of Science

They hypothesize further that the enriched scenario corresponds to the way expert epistemologists implicitly interpret the original one. However, no precise account of this implicit enrichment is offered, which makes the proposal somewhat ad hoc. Drawing on pragmatic theory, I argue that the content of Grundmann and Horvath's modified scenario corresponds to the default interpretation of the original scenario and that epistemological expertise is not required to access the deviance-proof interpretation.

A 2 (gender: male, female) x 3 (knowledge case: knowledge control, Gettier, ignorance control) experimental design was used with a sample of 420 U.S. adults. Contrary to hypotheses, participants attributed similar levels of knowledge to male and female agents across all knowledge conditions; participants also rated males and females as equally likely to have the 'right' answer across knowledge conditions. However, knowledge was more likely to be attributed to luck (as opposed to ability) for female agents than it was for male agents across knowledge conditions and scenarios. This result suggests that while overt forms of gender bias may be fading, more covert forms still exist. Secondary analyses also showed that the JTB methodology was not robust to scenario type or knowledge condition. Comprehension was affected by both knowledge condition (knowledge vs. Gettier/ignorance) and the specific content of the hypothetical scenario presented (e.g., squirrel vs. jewelery). These confounds should be addressed in future JTB studies as it is possible that differences between knowledge and Gettier cases are due to misunderstanding the scenarios rather than beliefs about knowledge.

Research suggests that philosophers tend to perform better on this test than non-philosophers, and that men tend to perform better than women. Taken together, these findings could be interpreted as partially explaining the gender gap that exists in Philosophy: there are fewer women in Philosophy because women are less likely to possess the ideal 'philosophical personality'. If this explanation for the gender gap in Philosophy is accepted, it might be seen to exonerate Philosophy departments of the need to put in place much-needed strategies for promoting gender diversity. This paper discusses a number of reasons for thinking that this would be the wrong conclusion to draw from the research. Firstly, the CRT may not track what it is claimed it tracks. Secondly, the trait tracked by the CRT may not be something that we should value in philosophers. Thirdly, even if we accept that the CRT tracks a trait that has value, this trait might be of limited importance to good philosophising. Lastly, the causal story linking the gender gap in CRT score and the gender gap in Philosophy is likely to be far more complex than this explanation implies.","[Easton, Christina] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, LSE, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Easton, C (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, LSE, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",C.E.Easton@lse.ac.uk,,"Easton, Christina/0000-0001-7018-7112",,,,,109,7,8,1,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0039-7857,1573-0964,,SYNTHESE,Synthese,JAN,2021,198,1,,,,,139,167,,10.1007/s11229-018-01986-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11229-018-01986-w,,,29,History & Philosophy Of Science; Philosophy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),History & Philosophy of Science; Philosophy,PV6LP,,"hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2024-07-12,WOS:000610097900006,View Full Record in Web of Science

The core idea is that in cases of knowledge the fact that the agent gets a true belief is attributable to her cognitive competence (competence condition), and not to some lucky factor. Critics have presented cases where, purportedly, the agent can either have knowledge without satisfying the competence condition (therefore, the competence condition would not be necessary for knowledge), or, despite the satisfaction of the competence condition, the agent has no knowledge (therefore, the competence condition would not be sufficient for knowledge). The crux of the matter lies in how to conceive properly the competence condition for knowledge, and the underlying relationship between competence and success in the epistemic domain. This paper explores Sosa's view of this relationship in terms of cognitive success that manifests the agent's competence, and proposes that it provides a more direct answer to the critics than do other epistemic virtue accounts of knowledge.","[Etcheverry, Katia M.] Pontificia Univ Catolica Rio Grande do Sul PUC RS, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",Pontificia Universidade Catolica Do Rio Grande Do Sul,"Etcheverry, KM (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Rio Grande do Sul PUC RS, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",kaetch@gmail.com,,"Etcheverry, Katia/0000-0002-0093-1089",,,,,26,1,2,0,0,UNESP-MARILIA,MARILIA,"AV HYGINO MUZZI FILHO, 737, MARILIA, SP 17525-900, BRAZIL",0101-3173,1980-539X,,TRANS-FORM-ACAO,Trans-Form-Acao,,2021,44,,,,2,,185,200,,10.1590/0101-3173.2021.v44dossier2.13.p185,http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/0101-3173.2021.v44dossier2.13.p185,,,16,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,ZA9HA,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-07-12,WOS:000756465200013,View Full Record in Web of Science

The criticism directed to what I call methodology of evaluation by intuitions shows that epistemologists often idealize the reliability of intuitions when assessing a theory against potential counterexamples, ignoring that the disposition to answer intuitively to a case of concept attribution is bounded to the familiar dimension in which the relevant conceptual competence emerges. Thus, the reliability of intuitions does not necessarily extend to far-fetched cases. Given that the assessment by our intuitions is not sufficient to decide for or against an epistemological theory, I offer a sketch for a pragmatic and naturalized conception of theoretical decision-making in epistemology.","[Rolla, Giovanni] Univ Fed Bahia, Programa Posgrad Filosofia, Largo de Sao Lazaro 197 Federacao, BR-40210909 Salvador, BA, Brazil",Universidade Federal da Bahia,"Rolla, G (corresponding author), Univ Fed Bahia, Programa Posgrad Filosofia, Largo de Sao Lazaro 197 Federacao, BR-40210909 Salvador, BA, Brazil.",rollagiovanni@gmail.com,"Rolla, Giovanni/ABE-6076-2020","Rolla, Giovanni/0000-0002-3865-3897",,,,,30,1,2,0,0,UNIV DO VALE DO RIO DOS SINOS,SAO LEOPOLDO,"AV UNISINOS 950 CP 275, SAO LEOPOLDO, RS 93001-970, BRAZIL",1519-5023,1984-8234,,FILOS UNISINOS,Filos.

The components of knowledge are discussed, aiming at clarifying what exactly the knowledge consists of. Several dialogues of Plato pose certain questions on the nature of knowledge, and here particularly Meno and Alcibiases-1 are taken into consideration, as well as Proclus' Commentary on Plato's Alcibiades-1. It is impossible, according to Plato, to learn anything at all if we lack knowledge about ourselves, as it is shown in Alcibiades-1. Despite being relatively short, the dialogue is considered by some ancient scholars to be the introduction to the whole philosophy of Plato, according to Proclus' Commentary on the dialogue. As a result, it has been inferred that there is no proof that gives us the right to assert that we possess any reliable knowledge in general, following the example on the authenticity of the dialogue in particular. This is why a parallel question, the authenticity of Alcibiades-1, is being discussed here on the basis of Proclus' work in order to define the concept of lost knowledge and to consider the possibility of how certain knowledge can become lost. Excerpts from the first Ukrainian translation of the aforementioned Plato's dialogues (yet to be published) and from Proclus' Commentary are given to provide proof for given statements.

Is deduction a source of knowledge? The answer seems to be in the positive when it is claimed that deductive inference draws the consequences of our hypotheses and brings them to the test of experience. I basically agree with this claim, but I also think that a careful analysis is needed on what we mean in this context by source and knowledge in particular. We must distinguish, as Vailati did, heuristic from epistemic value. Making deductive predictions does not amount to acquiring knowledge, but it certainly has heuristic value. So, deduction is not a source of knowledge if by source we mean a necessary or a sufficient condition of it, but it is a source of knowledge if we mean something like a heuristic device.","[Tuzet, Giovanni] Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy",Bocconi University,"Tuzet, G (corresponding author), Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy.",giovanni.tuzet@unibocconi.it,,,,,,,57,0,0,0,1,EDIZIONI ETS,PISA,"Lungarno Mediceo 16, 56127 PISA, ITALY",2281-8618,2282-0248,,PHILOS INQ,Philos.

Traditionally, legal systems have been regarded as contingently coercive. This view is mainly supported by the society of angels thought experiment. For the past few years, however, this traditional view has been under attack. Critics have challenged the reliability of the thought experiment and have urged us to centre the discussion on typical legal systems: legal systems made by humans to address human needs. Once we do so - they claim - we would inevitably reject the traditional view. This paper argues that the critics are wrong. After discussing key features of the society of angels thought experiment and responding to objections, it is argued that even typical legal systems are contingently coercive.

So Cohen gives Lewis some alternatives (which are explained in The Strategy of Biting the Bullet and the Problem of Interference and Biting the Bullet Strategy as a Natural Extension of Contextualist Resolution to the Sceptical Problem and the Pity Poor Bill Variation of the Lottery Problem sections) to avoid this counterintuitive result; this attempt, however, affects some other presuppositions of the contextual theory of David Lewis.

This has been due mainly to the rise of effective machine learning and deep learning algorithms, together with increases in data collection and processing power, which have made rapid progress in many areas. However, use of this technology has brought with it philosophical issues and practical problems, in particular, epistemic and ethical. In this paper the authors, with backgrounds in philosophy, maternity care practice and clinical research, draw upon and extend a recent framework for shared decision-making (SDM) that identified a duty of care to the client's knowledge as a necessary condition for SDM. This duty entails the responsibility to acknowledge and overcome epistemic defeaters. This framework is applied to the use of AI in maternity care, in particular, the use of machine learning and deep learning technology to attempt to enhance electronic fetal monitoring (EFM). In doing so, various sub-kinds of epistemic defeater, namely, transparent, opaque, underdetermined, and inherited defeaters are taxonomized and discussed. The authors argue that, although effective current or future AI-enhanced EFM may impose an epistemic obligation on the part of clinicians to rely on such systems' predictions or diagnoses as input to SDM, such obligations may be overridden by inherited defeaters, caused by a form of algorithmic bias. The existence of inherited defeaters implies that the duty of care to the client's knowledge extends to any situation in which a clinician (or anyone else) is involved in producing training data for a system that will be used in SDM. Any future AI must be capable of assessing women individually, taking into account a wide range of factors including women's preferences, to provide a holistic range of evidence for clinical decision-making.","[Begley, Keith] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Philosophy, Dublin, Ireland; [Begley, Cecily; Smith, Valerie] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Nursing & Midwifery, Dublin, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin; Trinity College Dublin,"Begley, K (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Philosophy, Dublin, Ireland.",begleyk@tcd.ie,"Smith, Valerie/AFQ-3592-2022","Smith, Valerie/0000-0003-2249-6038; Begley, Keith/0000-0003-1448-4344",,,,,40,8,8,2,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1356-1294,1365-2753,,J EVAL CLIN PRACT,J.

Second, we discuss two of the most popular responses in more detail: the expertise defense and the mischaracterization objection. Our take on the expertise defense is that the available empirical data do not support the claim that professional philosophers enjoy relevant expertise in their intuitive judgments about cases. In contrast, the mischaracterization objection seems considerably more promising than its largely negative reception has suggested. We argue that the burden of proof is thus on philosophers who still hold that the method of cases crucially relies on intuitive judgments about cases. Finally, we discuss whether conceptual engineering provides an alternative to the method of cases in light of the challenge from experimental philosophy. We argue that this is not clearly the case, because conceptual engineering also requires descriptive information about the concepts it aims to improve. However, its primarily normative perspective on our concepts makes it largely orthogonal to the challenge from experimental philosophy, and it can also benefit from the empirical methods of the latter.","[Horvath, Joachim; Koch, Steffen] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Philosophy 2, Univ Str 150, D-44801 Bochum, Germany",Ruhr University Bochum,"Horvath, J (corresponding author), Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Philosophy 2, Univ Str 150, D-44801 Bochum, Germany.",joachim.horvath@rub.de,,"Koch, Steffen/0000-0002-9360-799X; Horvath, Joachim/0000-0003-2713-5135",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft Germany [391304769],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft Germany(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft Germany, Grant/Award Number: 391304769",,124,10,11,1,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,1747-9991,,PHILOS COMPASS,Philos.

According to this thesis, an epistemically-oriented concept of information must have truth as one of its necessary conditions. Two challenges can be raised against VT. First, some philosophers object that veridicalists erroneously ignore the informativeness of false messages. Secondly, it is not clear whether VT can adequately explain the information considered in hypothetical reasoning. In this sense, logical diagrams offer an interesting case of analysis: by manipulating a logical diagram we can verify that a certain conclusion follows from a set of premises, but it cannot help us to determine the actual truth-value of a given set of propositions. Focusing on the latter challenge, in this paper I claim that logical diagrams set out potential counterexamples to VT and, consequently, pose a real challenge to this thesis. First, a veridicalist analysis of logical diagrams requires the assumption of metatheoretical properties which are not satisfied by some logical systems (and, consequently, are not satisfied by some systems of logical diagrams). So, VT does not fit well as a general framework for a theory of logical diagrammatic information. Secondly, based on semantic inferentialism, one can propose a normative interpretation of the inferential content of logical diagrams not exposed to the problems faced by VT. Moreover, there are several reasons to believe that veridicalism cannot accommodate such a normative interpretation. In other words, normativism represents a real (though still underexplored) alternative to veridicality. Due to these reasons, I conclude that, until further research, we should adopt a more parsimonious standpoint and say that logical diagrams provide inferential information simply.","[Mendonca, Bruno Ramos] Univ Estadual Campinas, Ctr Log Epistemol & Hist Sci, UNICAMP, CLE, Campinas, SP, Brazil",Universidade Estadual de Campinas,"Mendonça, BR (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Campinas, Ctr Log Epistemol & Hist Sci, UNICAMP, CLE, Campinas, SP, Brazil.",bruno.ramos.mendonca@gmail.com,,,Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES/Brazil) [88887.475401/2020-00],Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES/Brazil)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),The author is supported by a postdoc scholarship from Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES/Brazil: project #88887.475401/2020-00).,,40,1,1,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6495,1572-8641,,MIND MACH,Minds Mach.,MAR,2021,31,1,,,,,99,120,,10.1007/s11023-020-09547-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11023-020-09547-2,,OCT 2020,22,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science,QI3MJ,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000585832200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

These techniques save the economic armchair to the extent that they align laypeople judgments with economic theory by increasing cognitive effort and reflection in experimental subjects. It is natural to hypothesize that a similar strategy might work to address theexperimentalorrestrictionist challengeto armchair philosophy. To test this hypothesis, a randomized controlled experiment was carried out (for incentives and learning), as well as two lab experiments (for group consultation, and for experimental control). Three types of knowledge attribution tasks were used (Gettier cases, false belief cases, and cases in which there is knowledge on the consensus/orthodox understanding).

One part of a standard answer since Aristotle: the event was caused, at least in part, by S's bad will. But recently, there's been some insightful discussion of cases where the event's causes do not include any bad will from S and yet it seems that S is not off the hook for the event. Cheshire Calhoun, Miranda Fricker, Elinor Mason, David Enoch, Randolph Clarke, and others include in this category some cases of glitches, forgetfulness, inattentiveness, the actions of one's children or one's country, and certain instances of explicit bias and implicit bias. Enoch and Mason argue that in these cases, S should extend the realm of S's responsibility. Drawing on Aristotle's emphases on retrospective attitudes and the non-voluntary, this paper attempts to clarify the relation between quality of will and blameworthiness. I analyze cases where (a) S is clearly not morally responsible for an action or event, E, yet (b) S deserves reproach for E unless S has the appropriate retrospective attitudes (such as regret) or the absence of inappropriate attitudes toward E.","[Coren, Daniel] McMaster Univ, Philosophy Dept, Hamilton, ON, Canada",McMaster University,"Coren, D (corresponding author), McMaster Univ, Philosophy Dept, Hamilton, ON, Canada.",corenda@mcmaster.ca,,"Coren, Daniel/0000-0001-9650-1739",,,,,25,1,1,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2153-9596,2153-960X,,ANAL PHILOS,Anal.

Recent, non-distributive alternatives, which make unfairness unnecessary for exploitation, largely avoid these problems, but their arguments for the non-necessity of unfairness are unconvincing. This paper defends a two factor account according to which A exploits B iff A gains unfairly from B and either A believes that the gains he receives in the transaction wrong B, or A is culpably unaware that the gains he receives in the transaction wrong B.

To do this, we will consider two of the most influential and archetypal formulations of the problem: William L.

We will consider the relevance of experimental philosophy to Rowe's 1979 argument in 1 and to Draper's 1989 argument in 2. But in addition to exploring how the resources of experimental philosophy might apply to the problem of evil, it is also worth exploring what broader empirical factors might contribute to people having the intuitions that they have-from someone's affective state to someone's need for closure.

But Gettier cases are in dispute: Williamson takes them to induce substantive philosophical knowledge; Machery claims that the ambitious use of MoC should be abandoned entirely. We defend an intermediate position. We offer an internal critique of Macherian pessimism about Gettier cases. Most crucially, we argue that Gettier cases needn't exhibit 'disturbing characteristics' that Machery posits to explain why philosophical cases induce dubious judgments. It follows, we show, that Machery's central argument for the effective abandonment of MoC is undermined. Nevertheless, we engineer a restricted variant of the argument-in harmony with Williamsonian ideology-that survives our critique, potentially limiting philosophy's scope for establishing especially ambitious modal theses, despite traditional MoC's utility being partially preserved.","[Hawke, Peter; Schoonen, Tom] Univ Amsterdam, Inst Log Language & Computat, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Hawke, Peter; Schoonen, Tom] Univ St Andrews, Arche, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland",University of Amsterdam; University of St Andrews,"Schoonen, T (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Inst Log Language & Computat, Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Schoonen, T (corresponding author), Univ St Andrews, Arche, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland.",T.Schoonen@uva.nl,,"Schoonen, Tom/0000-0002-5403-8296; Hawke, Peter/0000-0002-6810-7918",European Research Council (ERC CoG) [681404],European Research Council (ERC CoG)(European Research Council (ERC)),"Thanks to our reviewers for exceptionally stimulating and helpful feedback.

Combining elements from statistical learning, causal interventionism, and decision theory, we design an idealised explanation game in which players collaborate to find the best explanation(s) for a given algorithmic prediction. Through an iterative procedure of questions and answers, the players establish a three-dimensional Pareto frontier that describes the optimal trade-offs between explanatory accuracy, simplicity, and relevance. Multiple rounds are played at different levels of abstraction, allowing the players to explore overlapping causal patterns of variable granularity and scope. We characterise the conditions under which such a game is almost surely guaranteed to converge on a (conditionally) optimal explanation surface in polynomial time, and highlight obstacles that will tend to prevent the players from advancing beyond certain explanatory thresholds. The game serves a descriptive and a normative function, establishing a conceptual space in which to analyse and compare existing proposals, as well as design new and improved solutions.","[Watson, David S.; Floridi, Luciano] Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, 41 St Giles, Oxford OX1 3LW, England; [Floridi, Luciano] British Lib, Alan Turing Inst, 96 Euston Rd, London NW1 2DB, England",University of Oxford,"Watson, DS (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, 41 St Giles, Oxford OX1 3LW, England.",david.watson@oii.ox.ac.uk,"Floridi, Luciano/G-7699-2014","Floridi, Luciano/0000-0002-5444-2280; Watson, David/0000-0001-9632-2159",Fujitsu academic grant,Fujitsu academic grant,Luciano Floridi's research for this article was supported by a Fujitsu academic grant.,,123,25,25,1,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0039-7857,1573-0964,,SYNTHESE,Synthese,OCT,2021,198,10,,,,,9211,9242,,10.1007/s11229-020-02629-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11229-020-02629-9,,APR 2020,32,History & Philosophy Of Science; Philosophy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),History & Philosophy of Science; Philosophy,UW5JV,,"hybrid, Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-07-12,WOS:000523108400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

On Pritchard's highly influential modal account of epistemic luck, luckily true beliefs are, roughly, those for which there are many close possible worlds in which the same belief formed in the same way is false. My aim is to introduce a new challenge to this account. Starting from the observation-as documented by a number of recent EEG studies-that our capacity to detect visual stimuli fluctuates with the phase of our neural oscillations, I argue that there can be very close possible worlds in which an actual-world detectable stimulus is undetectable. However, this doesn't diminish our willingness to attribute knowledge in the case that the stimulus is detectable, even when undetectability would result in the same belief formed in the same way being false. As I will argue at length, the modal account appears unable to accommodate this result.","[Bricker, Adam Michael] Univ Oulu, Hist Sci & Ideas, Oulu, Finland",University of Oulu,"Bricker, AM (corresponding author), Univ Oulu, Hist Sci & Ideas, Oulu, Finland.",adam.michael.bricker@gmail.com,,"Bricker, Adam/0000-0003-1509-3302",University of Oulu including Oulu University Hospital,University of Oulu including Oulu University Hospital,"Open access funding provided by University of Oulu including Oulu University Hospital.

Most researchers admit that knowledge is factive, which is due to the standard definition of knowledge as true justified belief. But the question of the factivity of knowability is much more complex. This is especially evident in the context of debates on the Fitch paradox. The paradox shows that the straightforward formalization of 'p is knowable' as 'it is possible that p is known' is incorrect because it readily leads to a contradiction (granted some intuitively appealing principles). Those who want to preserve the principle of knowability (according to which every truth is knowable) attempt to elaborate alternative formalizations of knowability, free from paradoxical implications. Among them are Dorothy Edgington and Michael Fara. Edgington defines p's knowability as the possibility to know that p is true in the actual world, which renders knowability factive. Timothy Williamson's criticism on her proposal shows that it has some substantial flaws. Fara wants to amend Edgington's proposal preserving the factivity of knowability. He defines knowability of a proposition p as there actually being an agent who is capable to know that p is actually true. This definition also implies that knowability is factive. I examine Fara's proposal and show that it is essentially incomplete because of two reasons. First, Fara does not provide syntactic rules for the operator 'C-x' that he introduces to symbolize the agents' capacity to have knowledge. Secondly, I show that the standard modal semantics cannot be used in interpreting his definition of knowability, whereas he does not propose any nonstandard semantics for it. I argue that the flaws of both theories are due to the fact that they treat knowability as factive. This motivates my hypothesis that a concept of knowability free from factivity is needed to solve Fitch's paradox.","[Borisov, Evgeny, V] Russian Acad Sci, Tomsk Sci Ctr, Siberian Branch, Tomsk, Russia",Tomsk Scientific Center of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences; Russian Academy of Sciences,"Borisov, EV (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Tomsk Sci Ctr, Siberian Branch, Tomsk, Russia.",borisov.evgeny@gmail.com,"Borisov, Evgeny V./T-3807-2017",,Russian Science Foundation [18-18-00057]; Russian Science Foundation [18-18-00057] Funding Source: Russian Science Foundation,Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)); Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)),"The study is supported by the Russian Science Foundation, Project No. 18-18-00057.",,15,1,1,0,0,TOMSK STATE UNIV,TOMSK,"LENIN AVE, 36, TOMSK, 634050, RUSSIA",1998-863X,2311-2395,,VESTN TOMSK U-FILOS,Vestn.

Epistemic externalists, on the other hand, deny this. More specifically, externalists think that the supervenience base of justification isn't exhausted by one's internal reasons for believing certain propositions. In the last decade, the internalism-externalism debate has made its mark on the epistemology of testimony. The proponent of internalism about the epistemology of testimony claims that a hearer's testimonial justification for believing that p supervenes upon his internal reasons for thinking that the speaker's testimony that p is true. Recently, however, several objections have been raised against this view. In this paper, I present an argument providing intuitive support for internalism about the epistemology of testimony. Moreover, I also defend the argument against three recent objections offered by Stephen Wright in a couple of recent papers. The upshot of my discussion is that external conditions do make an epistemic difference when it comes to our testimonial beliefs, but that they cannot make any difference with respect to their justificatory status - i.e., they are justificationally irrelevant.","[Egeland, Jonathan] Stockholm Univ, Philosophy, Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Egeland, J (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Philosophy, Stockholm, Sweden.",Jonathan.egeland.harouny@philosophy.su.se,"Egeland, Jonathan/AHD-2017-2022","Egeland, Jonathan/0000-0001-5522-6777",,,,,47,0,0,0,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1742-3600,1750-0117,,EPISTEME-J INDIV SOC,Episteme,DEC,2020,17,4,,,,,458,474,PII S1742360018000485,10.1017/epi.2018.48,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/epi.2018.48,,,17,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,PH7OC,,Green Submitted,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000600596100004,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this article we argue that the advantage of the history of knowledge is its capacity to open up new possibilities for historical work and reflection that are deeply infused with interdisciplinary perspectives and tools. This is important because, within both the academy and in society and politics more widely, we are actually within a knowledge turn or moment in which the stakes of delivering and challenging knowledge are unusually high. At the level of events, experiences, and concepts, the knowledge turn needs examination. The articles in this theme issue also show how issues within the theory of history and the theory of knowledge are ripe for deeper understanding, as both explore deeply issues and doubts about such things as historical development and progress and the existence and importance of knowledge itself, its relation to science and humanistic endeavors, as well as its European, Western, and global historical contexts. These articles also advance a knowledge toolkit of great attraction for historians of all subfields: notions like disknowledge, delay, conceptual and logical comparison, media, materiality, information, and networks are dynamic and productive. In the end, we argue that historical knowledge is itself a key concept that is open to present and past, necessarily constructive in orientation, and skeptical in approach without denying that some types of knowing are more powerful than others and that knowledge as a concept and topic strengthens our interdisciplinary historical and cultural work.","[Jordheim, Helge] Univ Oslo, Oslo, Norway; [Shaw, David Gary] Wesleyan Univ, Middletown, CT 06459 USA",University of Oslo; Wesleyan University,"Jordheim, H (corresponding author), Univ Oslo, Oslo, Norway.",,,,,,,,46,5,6,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0018-2656,1468-2303,,HIST THEORY,Hist.

The argument roughly aims at indicating that a complete physical knowledge of the world, would not include the knowledge of phenomenal properties of experience, therefore physicalism is false. In addition to his anti-physicalist thesis, Jackson further claims that phenomenal qualities of experiences are epiphenomenal. However, according to the inconsistency objection that is based upon a causal theory of knowledge, the knowledge argument undermines epiphenomenalism, because gaining the knowledge of phenomenal experience requires that phenomenal states are causally potent. However, the criticism can be challenged by developing a causal account of phenomenal knowledge without attributing a causal function of phenomenal properties. In this paper, it will be claimed that such a causal account is possible based on the notions of reliability and of common causal origin phenomenal experience and phenomenal knowledge, hence that epiphenomenalism and the knowledge argument are not necessarily inconsistent.","[Sandikcioglu, Pakize Arikan] Izmir Katip Celebi Univ, Sosyal & Beseri Bilimler Fak, Felsefe Bolumu, TR-35620 Izmir, Turkey",Izmir Katip Celebi University,"Sandikcioglu, PA (corresponding author), Izmir Katip Celebi Univ, Sosyal & Beseri Bilimler Fak, Felsefe Bolumu, TR-35620 Izmir, Turkey.",pakizearikan@yahoo.com,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,3,BEYTULHIKME FELSEFE CEVRESI,ANKARA,"ASAGI OVECLER MAH, 1307 SOK NO 4-2, CANKAYA, ANKARA, 06460, TURKEY",1303-8303,,,BEYTULHIKME,Beytulhikme,DEC,2020,10,4,,,,,1219,1234,,10.18491/beytulhikme.1673,http://dx.doi.org/10.18491/beytulhikme.1673,,,16,Philosophy,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Philosophy,PN2WY,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000604346200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The influential knowledge first program in epistemology reverses this tradition, taking knowledge as its starting point. From the perspective of epistemic logic, however, this is not so much a reversal as it is the default-the field arguably begins with the specialization of necessity to epistemic necessity-that is, it begins with knowledge. In this context, putting knowledge second would be the reversal. This article motivates, develops, and explores such a knowledge second approach in epistemic logic, founded on distinguishing what a body of evidence actually entails from what it is (merely) believed to entail. We import a logical framework that captures exactly this distinction, use it to define formal notions of (internal and external) justification and knowledge, and investigate applications to the KK principle, the strong belief postulate, and the regress problem.","[Bjorndahl, Adam] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Carnegie Mellon University,"Bjorndahl, A (corresponding author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",abjorn@cmu.edu,,,,,,,11,1,2,0,0,PHILOSOPHY DOCUMENTATION CENTER,CHARLOTTESVILLE,"PO BOX 7147, CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA 22906-7147 USA",2168-9105,2168-9113,,RES PHILOS,Res Philos.,OCT,2020,97,4,,,,,471,487,,10.11612/resphil.1948,http://dx.doi.org/10.11612/resphil.1948,,,17,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,PW1TQ,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000610459500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Second, all empirical knowledge ultimately depends on some modal knowledge. This article assesses Lowe's account and defends four conclusions. First, there is a tension in Lowe's account of grasp of essence; it wavers between an undemanding version, which holds that grasp of essence requires no more than our ordinary understanding of propositions, and a more demanding version, which holds that it requires rational insight into necessary relationships between essences. Second, both versions face serious challenges. Third, Lowe's account of knowledge of essence does not provide a basis for modal knowledge.

Lately, however, intuitions have come under attack and their justificatory force is being questioned. This essay asks whether we can acknowledge the epistemic fallibility of intuitions, while nevertheless reaching reliable normative conclusions. To that effect I investigate three different strategies of relating specific intuitions and more general normative principles: the intuitionist, coherentist, and foundationalist methods. Showing that none of them succeeds in making up for the problematic epistemic status of intuitions in the justificatory process, I conclude that normative principles are unreliable to the extent that they are based on thought-experiments.","[Huber, Jakob] Goethe Univ Frankfurt Main, Forsch Verbund Die Herausbildung Normativer Ordnu, D-60629 Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Huber, J (corresponding author), Goethe Univ Frankfurt Main, Forsch Verbund Die Herausbildung Normativer Ordnu, D-60629 Frankfurt, Germany.",j.huber@em.uni-frankfurt.de,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,1,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0012-1045,2192-1482,,DEUT Z PHILOS,Dtsch.

And its criteria for distinguishing legal norms within morality imply an under- or overinclusive set of legal norms. I stress the special difficulties that apply beyond obligations, in the case of privileges and powers, and I show that the view's problems do not only-or mainly-concern egregiously unjust law, or indeed morally defective law at all.

Unfortunately, using standard propositional quantification, and the usual relational semantics, this axiom is semantically inconsistent with a common logic for rational belief, namely KD45. Here we explore two alternative semantics for KD45 and the axiom of epistemic modesty. The first uses the usual relational semantics and bisimulation quantifiers. The second uses a topological semantics and standard propositional quantification. We show the two different semantics validate many of the same formulas, though we do not know whether they validate exactly the same formulas.

We discuss reductionism and epistemic trust as theoretical approaches to answer this question and present a novel solution that avoids major problems of both theoretical options: Performative Expert Testimony (PET). PET draws on a functional account of expertise insofar as it takes the expert's visibility as a good informant capable to satisfy informational needs as equally important as her specific skills and knowledge. We explain how PET generates justification for testimonial belief, which is at once assessable for non-experts and maintains the division of epistemic labor between them and the experts. Thereafter we defend PET against two objections. First, we point out that the non-expert's interest in acquiring widely assertable true beliefs and the expert's interest in maintaining her status as a good informant counterbalances the relativist account of justification at work in PET. Second, we show that with regard to the interests at work in testimonial exchanges between experts and non-experts, PET yields a better explanation of knowledge-acquisition from expert testimony than externalist accounts of justification such as reliabilism. As our arguments ground in a conception of knowledge, which conceives of belief-justification as a declarative speech act, throughout the rearmost sections of this paper we also indicate to how such a conception is operationalized in PET.","[Leefmann, Jon] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Ctr Appl Philosophy Sci & Key Qualificat, Bismarckstr 12, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany; [Lesle, Steffen] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Inst Philosophy, Bismarckstr 1, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg; University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Leefmann, J (corresponding author), Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Ctr Appl Philosophy Sci & Key Qualificat, Bismarckstr 12, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany.",jon.leefmann@fau.de; steffen.lesle@fau.de,"; Lesle, Steffen/R-1730-2018","Leefmann, Jon/0000-0001-5475-990X; Lesle, Steffen/0000-0002-4165-4452","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) [396775817]","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG))","Funded by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) - 396775817.",,63,7,8,2,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0039-7857,1573-0964,,SYNTHESE,Synthese,AUG,2020,197,8,,,SI,,3611,3641,,10.1007/s11229-018-01908-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11229-018-01908-w,,,31,History & Philosophy Of Science; Philosophy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),History & Philosophy of Science; Philosophy,MW4FP,,Green Submitted,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000556995200018,View Full Record in Web of Science

Before digitizing knowledge, a fundamental question arises: What is knowledge? In order to answer this question, this study first reviews the definitions of knowledge found in the extant literature of epistemology, engineering design, manufacturing, organization science, information science, and education science. Since the definitions reported so far are not succinct and suffer circularity, this study overcomes this by introducing a three-element-based definition of knowledge-a piece knowledge consists of three elements defined as claim, provenance, and inference. This results in four types of knowledge defined as definitional, deductive, inductive, and creative knowledge, and each type of knowledge is again divided into some categories. Some real-life scenarios relevant to engineering design and manufacturing are used to clarify the proposed knowledge types/categories; the relevant pieces of knowledge are represented by knowledge graphs (concept maps) for the sake of digitization. The myriad proximal and distal relationships between knowledge and other relevant entities (human/machine learning, logical inferences, experimental data, analytical results, creative thinking, and cognitive reflections) become succinct and transparent due to the proposed definition of knowledge. Consequently, this study establishes the fundamentals of developing sophisticated methods and tools for the advancement of Industry 4.0.","[Ullah, A. M. M.

It does not appear in the English chemistry curriculum and little is known about young people's beliefs about fracking, nor of their attitudes towards it. In this study we focus on young people in schools or colleges within a 20 mile radius of the nearest urban area to a fracking site in England. An in-depth qualitative focus group study was used to investigate the knowledge, beliefs and attitudes of 84 young people aged 16-19 in 4 schools and colleges. Young people reported knowledge about the process of fracking and to a lesser extent its social, economic and environmental impacts and associated regulation. Formal education was an important, if limited, source of information that tended to be trusted by young people. Negative and ambivalent attitudes towards fracking dominated, with the use of economic, environmental and social frames used by young people to inform their responses to fracking. Support for fracking hinged mainly upon energy supply and energy sovereignty. Fracking was opposed because of detrimental environmental and economic impacts, the impacts of associated protests and because of the political handling of decisions about fracking. The exclusion of young people, and the population of the area more broadly, from participation in decision-making has led to young people's disaffection with political processes and cynicism about the relationship between government and industry. The case of fracking demonstrates the importance of creating space for attention to political processes in chemistry education, and for engaging with young people about energy interventions in their community.","[Dunlop, Lynda; Atkinson, Lucy; Turkenburg-van Diepen, Maria] Univ York, Dept Educ, Dewent K Block Heslington York, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Dunlop, L (corresponding author), Univ York, Dept Educ, Dewent K Block Heslington York, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",lynda.dunlop@york.ac.uk,"; Turkenburg-van Diepen, Maria Gertrudis Wilhelmina/R-5134-2017","Dunlop, Lynda/0000-0002-0936-8149; Atkinson, Lucy/0000-0002-6384-2227; Turkenburg-van Diepen, Maria Gertrudis Wilhelmina/0000-0002-2841-3339",University of York Department of Education,University of York Department of Education,"We are grateful to the schools, colleges, teachers and young people who took part in this study.

To the traditional question that has dominated the debate - under what conditions does belief amount to knowledge? - they have added questions about testimony, epistemic virtues and vices, epistemic trust, and more. This broadening of the range of epistemic concern has coincided with an expansion in conceptions of epistemic agency beyond the individualism characteristic of most earlier epistemology. We believe that these developments have not gone far enough. While the weak anti-individualism we see in contemporary epistemology may be adequate for the kinds of cases it tends to focus on, a great deal of human knowledge production and transmission does not conform to these models. Furthermore, the dispositions and norms that are knowledge-conducive in the familiar cases may not be knowledge-conducive generally. In fact, dispositions that, at an individual level, count as epistemic vices may be epistemic virtues in common social contexts. We argue that this overlooked feature of human social life means that epistemology must become more deeply and pervasively social.","[Levy, Neil] Macquarie Univ, Macquarie Pk, NSW, Australia; [Levy, Neil] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Alfano, Mark] Delft Univ Technol, Delft, Netherlands; [Alfano, Mark] Australian Catholic Univ, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Macquarie University; University of Oxford; Delft University of Technology; Australian Catholic University,"Levy, N (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Macquarie Pk, NSW, Australia.;Levy, N (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Oxford, England.",neil.levy@philosophy.ox.ac.uk; mark.alfano@gmail.com,"Levy, Neil/H-3646-2019","Levy, Neil/0000-0002-5679-1986; Alfano, Mark/0000-0001-5879-8033",Australian Research Council; University of Connecticut; John Templeton Foundation [58942],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); University of Connecticut; John Templeton Foundation,"We are grateful to two extraordinarily helpful reviewers, and to the editors of Mind, for comments that enabled us greatly to improve this paper.

J,"Page, W",,,,"Page, Walker",,,Defending virtue epistemology: epistemic dependence in testimony and extended cognition,SYNTHESE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Virtue epistemology; Testimony; Extended cognition; Epistemic dependence,CREDIT,"This paper provides an account of how virtue epistemology can accommodate knowledge acquired through testimony and extended cognition. Section 1articulates the characteristic claim of virtue epistemology (VE), and introduces the issues discussed in the paper. Section 2details a related pair of objections to VE: that it is unable to accommodate cases of knowledge through (1) testimony and (2) extended cognition. Section 3reviews two different virtue epistemologies and their responses to these objections presented in Greco (Achieving knowledge, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge,2010; Philos Phenomenol Res 85(1):1-26,2012). Considerations are presented for why both of these accounts and responses are inadequate. Because of this, I suggest that it is unlikely that an analysis of theattributionrelation will provide an adequate response to the objections. Section 4advocates for a revised VE and a different way of dealing with the objections, which accommodates how agents are sometimes epistemically dependent on external sources. The central claim, for which a novel argument is presented, is that in some cases of knowledge (including the troublesome cases) the success is attributable to the abilities of an information system of which the knower is a part. This requires an important revision to traditional VE, but the characteristic claim of VE still holds true-every instance of knowledge is an instance of success attributable to ability. Thus, VE's solutions to problems concerning the nature and value of knowledge are secured.","[Page, Walker] St Louis Univ, Philosophy Dept, Adorjan Hall 130,3800 Lindell Blvd, St Louis, MO 63108 USA",Saint Louis University,"Page, W (corresponding author), St Louis Univ, Philosophy Dept, Adorjan Hall 130,3800 Lindell Blvd, St Louis, MO 63108 USA.",pagedw@slu.edu,,,,,,,30,1,1,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0039-7857,1573-0964,,SYNTHESE,Synthese,JUL,2020,197,7,,,SI,,2913,2936,,10.1007/s11229-017-1518-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11229-017-1518-5,,,24,History & Philosophy Of Science; Philosophy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),History & Philosophy of Science; Philosophy,MJ1ZS,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000547892700010,View Full Record in Web of Science

There is also an emerging consensus in the literature that privacy rights lack a unified core. This Article demonstrates that these are both mistaken conclusions that derive from the conflation of privacy losses and violations, and it develops a theory of privacy that untangles these misunderstood concepts at the heart of privacy law. In clarifying the outcome-based criteria for privacy losses and their relationship with the path-based criteria for privacy violations, this theory provides value across two domains. First, regarding the coherence of the law, it demonstrates that a unified theory of privacy rights is possible despite significant disagreement about their content. Second, regarding the law's content, it challenges orthodox views about how the aggregation, use, and inference of personal information violate privacy rights.","[Skopek, Jeffrey M.] Univ Cambridge, Fac Law, Cambridge, England",University of Cambridge,"Skopek, JM (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Fac Law, Cambridge, England.",,"Skopek, Jeffrey/HCH-4143-2022",,,,,,151,7,7,0,5,"UNIV IOWA, COLL LAW",IOWA CITY,"290 BOYD LAW BLDG, IOWA CITY, IA 52242 USA",0021-0552,,,IOWA LAW REV,Iowa Law Rev.,JUL,2020,105,5,,,,,2169,2231,,,,,,63,Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Government & Law,NC3XY,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000561149100004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Do these academics therefore also have different ideas about when someone possesses knowledge? Recent experimental findings suggest that intuitions about when individuals have knowledge may vary across groups; in particular, the concept of knowledge espoused by the discipline of philosophy may not align with the concept held by laypeople. Across two studies, we investigate the concept of knowledge held by academics across seven disciplines (N = 1,581) and compare these judgments to those of philosophers (N = 204) and laypeople (N = 336). We find that academics and laypeople share a similar concept of knowledge, while philosophers have a substantially different concept. These experiments show that (a) in contrast to philosophers, other academics and laypeople attribute knowledge to others in some Gettier situations; (b) academics and laypeople are much less likely to attribute knowledge when reminded of the possibility of error, but philosophers are not affected by this reminder; and (c) non-philosophy academics are overall more skeptical about knowledge than laypeople or philosophers. These findings suggest that academics across a wide range of disciplines share a similar concept of knowledge, and that this concept aligns closely with the intuitions held by laypeople, and differs considerably from the concept of knowledge described in the philosophical literature, as well as the epistemic intuitions of philosophers themselves.","[Starmans, Christina] Univ Toronto, Dept Psychol, 100 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada; [Friedman, Ori] Univ Waterloo, Dept Psychol, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Toronto; University of Waterloo,"Starmans, C (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Psychol, 100 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S 3G3, Canada.;Friedman, O (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Dept Psychol, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",christina.starmans@utoronto.ca; friedman@uwaterloo.ca,"Friedman, Ori/K-5429-2012","Friedman, Ori/0000-0003-2346-9787",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR),OF's contributions to this work were funded by a grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

In this paper, I argue against the assumption that imperfect conformity to our intuitions about test cases must count against a theory about peer disagreement, offer a principled way of (sometimes) shrugging off a theory's failure to deliver the intuitive verdict, and consider the main extant theories from the new methodological perspective.","[Weintraub, Ruth] Tel Aviv Univ, Philosophy Dept, IL-69978 Ramat Aviv, Israel",Tel Aviv University,"Weintraub, R (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Philosophy Dept, IL-69978 Ramat Aviv, Israel.",weintrar@post.tau.ac.il,,,,,,,45,0,2,0,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0031-8116,1573-0883,,PHILOS STUD,Philos.

I consider three types of psychological explanation for a viewer's shift in beliefs: (1) increased bonding or empathy, (2) various forms of cognitive bias, and (3) type of cognitive processing involved. I consider the normative implications of each explanation, arguing that in each case the viewer's judgment is presumptively rational.","[Giebel, Heidi M.] Univ St Thomas, 2115 Summit Ave, St Paul, MN 55105 USA",University of St Thomas Minnesota,"Giebel, HM (corresponding author), Univ St Thomas, 2115 Summit Ave, St Paul, MN 55105 USA.",hmgiebel@stthomas.edu,"Giebel, Heidi/ABE-4346-2021","Giebel, Heidi/0000-0002-8040-2119",,,,,42,2,2,0,4,"JAGIELLONIAN UNIV, INST PHILOSOPHY",KRAKOW,"UL GRODZKA 52, KRAKOW, 31-041, POLAND",1733-5566,,,DIAMETROS,Diametros,JUN,2020,17,64,,,,,22,35,,10.33392/diam.1472,http://dx.doi.org/10.33392/diam.1472,,,14,Philosophy,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Philosophy,MG7BK,,gold,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000546184100003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The challenge is inspired by contemporary philosophers who describe themselves as practicing ordinary language philosophy. Contemporary ordinary language philosophy can be divided into constructive and critical approaches. The critical approach to contemporary ordinary language philosophy has been forcefully developed by Avner Baz, who attempts to show that a substantial chunk of contemporary philosophy is fundamentally misguided. I describe Baz's project and argue that while there is reason to be skeptical of its radical conclusion, it conveys an important truth about discontinuities between ordinary uses of philosophically significant expressions (know, e.g.) and their use in philosophical thought experiments. I discuss some evidence from experimental psychology and behavioral economics indicating that there is a risk of overlooking important aspects of meaning or misinterpreting experimental results by focusing only on abstract experimental scenarios, rather than employing more diverse and more ecologically valid experimental designs. I conclude by presenting a revised version of the critical argument from ordinary language.","[Hansen, Nat] Univ Reading, Dept Philosophy, Reading RG6 6AA, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Hansen, N (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Dept Philosophy, Reading RG6 6AA, Berks, England.",n.d.hansen@reading.ac.uk,,"Hansen, Nat/0000-0001-5074-1075",,,,,73,14,14,2,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0039-7857,1573-0964,,SYNTHESE,Synthese,JUN,2020,197,6,,,SI,,2433,2464,,10.1007/s11229-018-1812-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11229-018-1812-x,,,32,History & Philosophy Of Science; Philosophy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),History & Philosophy of Science; Philosophy,LX7UT,,hybrid,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000540033200010,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Hurka, T",,,,"Hurka, Thomas",,,The Parallel Goods of Knowledge and Achievement,ERKENNTNIS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This paper examines what it takes to be the intrinsic human goods of knowledge and achievement and argues that they are at many points parallel. Both are compounds, and of parallel elements: belief, justification, and truth in the one case, and intentional pursuit, competence, and success in the other. Each involves a Moorean organic unity, so its full presence or value requires a connection between its elements: an outside-in connection, where what makes a belief true helps explain why it's justified, for knowledge, and an inside-out connection, where what makes a pursuit competent helps explain its success, for achievement. The features that determine the degrees of value of instances of the two goods, or make some truths more worth knowing and some goals more worth achieving, are also similar, turning in both cases largely on two forms of generality. And more specific goods that follow from valuing generality, such as integrated understanding and complex, difficult achievement, mirror each other structurally. Taken together, these many parallels suggest that knowledge and achievement may both instantiate a more abstract value of rational connection to reality. With or without that deeper unification, the parallels strengthen the claims of both to be genuine goods.","[Hurka, Thomas] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto,"Hurka, T (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.",tom.hurka@utoronto.ca,,,,,,,27,9,9,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0106,1572-8420,,ERKENNTNIS,Erkenntnis,JUN,2020,85,3,,,SI,,589,608,,10.1007/s10670-020-00245-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10670-020-00245-0,,,20,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,LQ7IS,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000535173800005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Key to this solution is the recognition of two distinct kinds of emotional skill (what I call generative emotional skill and doxastic emotional skill) and how these must be working in tandem when emotional experience plays such a justificatory role. The paper has two main parts, the first negative and the second positive. The negative part criticises the epistemic credentials of Epistemic Perceptualism (e.g., Tappolet, in: Clotilde (ed) Perceptual illusions.

The second part of the paper develops an account of emotional skill and uses this account to frame a revisionary form of Epistemic Perceptualism that succeeds where the traditional views could not. I conclude by considering some objections and replies.","[Carter, J.

J,"Kotzee, B",,,,"Kotzee, Ben",,,Show and Tell: Demonstration as Practical Testimony,JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,,KNOW-HOW; KNOWLEDGE,"Two classic questions in epistemology concern whether knowledge is firstly propositional or firstly practical (the know-that/know-how debate) and whether testimony is a basic source of epistemic justification (the reductionism/anti-reductionism debate about testimony). In this paper, I consider the relationship between these two classic debates in epistemology. I hold that consideration of the two questions in tandem adds perspective to both debates. Firstly, considering the question of testimony within the know-that/know-how debate makes clear the necessity of developing a concept of practical testimony within the epistemology of practical knowledge. In this paper, I draw on Hawley's work to develop such a concept and call it 'demonstration'. Secondly, considering the know-that/know-how debate in the epistemology of testimony sheds new light on the efficacy of testimony alone in transmitting knowledge. Because demonstration is not completely efficacious in transmitting know-how, I hold that the reductionism debate itself must diverge into propositional and practical halves. In the paper, I go on to identify two imperfect alliances: between intellectualism about know-how and anti-reductionism about testimony and between anti-intellectualism about know-how and reductionism about testimony. I also sketch out the importance of the concept of demonstration to understanding practical learning and teaching.","[Kotzee, Ben] Univ Birmingham, Sch Educ, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Kotzee, B (corresponding author), Univ Birmingham, Sch Educ, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",h.b.kotzee@bham.ac.uk,"Kotzee, Ben/HDN-7352-2022","Kotzee, Ben/0000-0003-0334-6368",,,,,36,0,1,0,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-8249,1467-9752,,J PHILOS EDUC,J.

My starting point is the often-voiced contention that thought insertion might challenge the thesis that introspection-based self-ascriptions of psychological properties are immune to error through misidentification relative to the first-person concept. In the first part of the paper I explain what a thought insertion-based counterexample to this immunity thesis should be like. I then argue that various thought insertion-involving scenarios do not give rise to successful counterexamples to the immunity of the target class of self-ascriptions. In the second part of the paper I turn to defend a Metasemantic Explanation of why the immunity thesis holds. The Metasemantic Explanation rests on a reference-fixing story about the mental 'I' whose key contention is that introspective impressions play an essential role in fixing its reference. It is part of my argument in favour of the proposed reference-fixing story, as well as of the Metasemantic Explanation, that they respect the paradigmatic features of self-ascriptions of inserted thoughts.","[Palmira, Michele] Univ Barcelona, Dept Philosophy, C Montalegre 6-8,Off 4067, Barcelona 08001, Spain; [Palmira, Michele] Univ Barcelona, BIAP LOGOS Res Grp, Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona; University of Barcelona,"Palmira, M (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Dept Philosophy, C Montalegre 6-8,Off 4067, Barcelona 08001, Spain.;Palmira, M (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, BIAP LOGOS Res Grp, Barcelona, Spain.",michelepalmira@gmail.com,"Palmira, Michele/ABB-2421-2021","Palmira, Michele/0000-0003-4025-0066",,,,,49,9,9,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0031-8116,1573-0883,,PHILOS STUD,Philos.

A subject is veritically lucky in his or her belief that p if this belief is true not due to its foundations (for example, reasons which an agent has to believe that p) but by mere accident. The acceptance of the thesis of incompatibility of knowledge with this kind of luck led to significant modifications of a popular modern epistemological tripartite analysis of propositional knowledge according to which subject knows that p if and only if he or she believes that p is true, p is actually true, and an agent's belief that p is true is justified. In his famous paper Is True Justified Belief Knowledge E. Gettier demonstrated that true justified belief may not be knowledge. The core of the problem is that in the cases described by Gettier and the like an agent's belief, though justified, is true by accident. This gave rise to a set of theories introducing additional conditions of knowledge which could exclude veritic luck. In this paper the author critically discusses main modifications of the tripartite concept of knowledge aimed at making it independent on veritic luck, and show that they are unable to solve this problem. He agrees with those who think that the very thesis of incompatibility of knowledge with veritic luck is wrong. But he disagrees that all kinds of veritic luck are compatible with knowledge: the author supposes that good veritic luck is compatible with knowledge only when it compensates some negative effect of antecedent bad epistemic luck. According to this view original Gettier examples are not cases of knowledge whereas brokenclocks case and fake-barns case are. This account allows treating many classic cases of dependence of knowledge on luck as cases of knowledge-acquirement, but in the same time it excludes the inclusion into the class of knowledge such intuitively irrelevant outcomes as lucky guess and wishful thinking.","[Chernyak, Alexey Z.] Peoples Friendship Univ Russia, 6 Miklukho Markaya St, Moscow 117198, Russia",Peoples Friendship University of Russia,"Chernyak, AZ (corresponding author), Peoples Friendship Univ Russia, 6 Miklukho Markaya St, Moscow 117198, Russia.",abishot2100@yandex.ru,"Chernyak, Alexei/A-7001-2017",,,,,,42,1,1,0,1,RUSSIAN ACAD SCIENCES-INST PHILOSOPHY,MOSCOW,"UL VOLHONKA, DOM 14-1, STR 5, MOSCOW, 119991, RUSSIA",1811-833X,2311-7133,,EPISTEMOL PHILOS SCI,Epistemol.

It defends the thesis that neo-Mooreans retain advantages and avoid disadvantages of rival anti-skeptical strategies namely epistemic contextualism. The puzzle that a radical skeptic poses is exemplified by Nozick's famous Brain in a Vat thought experiment, which enables construing valid arguments consisting of jointly inconsistent but independently plausible premises. The first and the second part of the paper are devoted to Nozick's conditional analysis of knowledge and De Rose's epistemic contextualism, both based on the sensitivity principle. Referring to De Roses' contextualist theory, we demonstrate that the failure of Nozick's conditional analysis of knowledge to provide a satisfactory answer to a skeptical paradox does not concern the sensitivity principle but rather closure denial and embracing the so-called abominable conjunction. In the third part, we point out the weaknesses of the presumably most successful, contextualist response to the paradox. We explain that even though DeRose's anti-skeptical strategy is built upon Nozick's theory, he successfully surmounts its difficulties. Yet it seems that as a contextualist, he necessarily makes some concessions to a radical skeptic. Eventually, the article introduces Black's neo-Moorean anti-skeptical theory based on the sensitivity principle as a strategy that makes neither concessions, nor counterintuitive proposals.","[Mijic, Jelena] Univ Belgrade, Fac Philosophy, Inst Philosophy, Belgrade, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Mijic, J (corresponding author), Univ Belgrade, Fac Philosophy, Inst Philosophy, Belgrade, Serbia.",mijicjel@gmail.com,"Mijic, Jelena/HGC-9798-2022","Mijic, Jelena/0000-0003-1666-1244",,,,,14,0,0,0,0,"UNIV BELGRADE, INST PHILOSOPHY & SOCIAL THEORY",BELGRADE,"KRALJICE NATALIJE 45, BELGRADE, 11000, SERBIA",0353-5738,2334-8577,,PHILOS SOC-FILOZOFIJ,Philos.

In these days of fake news and spurious Internet content, scholarly research needs to be able to demonstrate its validity: Are its findings true and its recommendations correct? We argue that there are fundamental validation criteria that can be applied to all research approaches despite their apparent diversity and conflict. These stem from current views on the nature of truth and the related but wider concept of correctness within philosophy. There has been much debate about the nature of truth: Is it correspondence, coherence, consensual, or pragmatic? Current debates revolve around the idea of a pluralist view of truth-that there are different forms of truth depending on the context or domain Related to truth is the wider concept of correctness: propositions may be true, but correctness can also be applied to actions, performances, or behavior for which truth is not appropriate. We develop a framework for research validity and apply it to a range of research forms including positivist, interpretive, design science, critical, and action oriented. The benefits are: (1) a greater and more explicit focus on validity criteria will produce better research; (2) having a single framework can provide some commonality between what, at times, seem like conflicting approaches to research; (3) having criteria made explicit should encourage debate and further development. The framework is applied to a variety of empirical papers employing varied research approaches.","[Mingers, John] Univ Kent, Syst & Operat Res, Canterbury, Kent, England; [Standing, Craig] Edith Cowan Univ, Strateg Informat Management, Churchlands, WA, Australia",University of Kent; Edith Cowan University,"Mingers, J (corresponding author), Univ Kent, Syst & Operat Res, Canterbury, Kent, England.",j.mingers@kent.ac.uk; c.standing@ecu.edu.au,,,,,,,205,8,12,5,41,ASSOC INFORMATION SYSTEMS,ATLANTA,"GEORGIA STATE UNIV, 35 BROAD STREET, STE 916-917, ATLANTA, GA 30303 USA",1536-9323,1558-3457,,J ASSOC INF SYST,J.

One way to question this practice and the role of intuitions is the so-called argument from unreliability. From this non-reliability a skeptical conclusion follows regarding the modal analyzes characteristic of certain philosophical arguments: the requirement of suspension of judgment concerning philosophical cases. This posit leads to maintain a philosophical immodesty regarding the epistemic limits that would not allow, for example, to solve the perennial disagreements present in the philosophical field. This in turn results in two questionable consequences of philosophical argumentation, according to Machery: dogmatism (dogmatism) and / or parochialism. My objective in this paper is to analyze what reliability notion is at stake in this negative experimental stance (negative Xphi) from the proposal developed by Goldman (2013), and to evaluate the validity of an empiricist skeptical stance, considering skepticism as prima facie speculative and, therefore, not empirically testable.

According to libertarians, volitional acts performed by agents constitute a specific type of causes, which are not themselves caused by other causes. In this respect, event-causal libertarianism is similar to the agent-causal libertarianism, because it insists that in performing a volitional act an agent can choose one of the alternative outcomes without being caused to do so by anything else, where 'anything else' includes all the facts about the past and the present. Since event-causal libertarians maintain that volitional acts and the causal role of agents can be explained naturalistically, they must solve the problem of luck, i.e., they must explain how an agent is able to control her choices, given that she can choose one way or another without there being any difference in her state immediately preceding the moment of choice. This problem arises not from the indeterminism per se, but from the way it is coupled with the causal role of agents. In section one, I consider the historical development of compatibilist views on physical determinism and indeterminism. In section two, I present an overview of conditional analyses of alternative possibilities. In section three, I analyze the reasons why libertarians reject any type of conditional analysis, and show that intuitive objections against physical determinism, which portrait it as an obstacle to freedom, are untenable. In section four, I consider the consequence argument and show how it is related to the libertarian condition of sourcehood. In the final section, I analyze the problem of luck and show that it inevitably arises for any version of libertarianism. I demonstrate that indeterminism is a problem for libertarians, although they need it. And it is not a problem for compatibilists, who, while they do not need it, can incorporate it in their theories without facing the problem of luck.","[Sekatskaya, Maria A.] St Petersburg State Univ, 5 Mendeleevskaya Lane, St Petersburg 199034, Russia",Saint Petersburg State University,"Sekatskaya, MA (corresponding author), St Petersburg State Univ, 5 Mendeleevskaya Lane, St Petersburg 199034, Russia.",maria.sekatskaya@gmail.com,"Sekatskaya, Maria A/N-1580-2013",,,,,,33,1,1,0,0,RUSSIAN ACAD SCIENCES-INST PHILOSOPHY,MOSCOW,"UL VOLHONKA, DOM 14-1, STR 5, MOSCOW, 119991, RUSSIA",1811-833X,2311-7133,,EPISTEMOL PHILOS SCI,Epistemol.

According to this view, such problems are among the central questions of epistemology, and answering them is essential for justifying the status of epistemology as a major branch of philosophical enquiry. I challenge this view by identifying an assumption on which Platonic value problems are based - the value assumption - and considering how this assumption might be resisted. After articulating a line of thought that supports the assumption, I highlight one way of undermining it, which is to deny that we desire knowledge and not just (e.g.) true belief because we prefer knowledge to true belief. I then consider an attempt to undermine the value assumption in this way, inspired by Bernard Williams. I contend that Williams's argument fails, but also that seeing why it fails is instructive for future attempts to resist the value assumption.","[Walker, Barney] Univ Warwick, Philosophy, Coventry, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Walker, B (corresponding author), Univ Warwick, Philosophy, Coventry, W Midlands, England.",B.Walker.3@warwick.ac.uk,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,0,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0031-8191,1469-817X,,PHILOSOPHY,Philosophy,JAN,2020,95,1,,,,,93,112,PII S0031819119000408,10.1017/S0031819119000408,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0031819119000408,,,20,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,JU8AN,,Green Submitted,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000501893100006,View Full Record in Web of Science

When a person's belief is epistemically worthy, she not only believes rightly, but does so in a way that reflects well on her and in such a way that she is creditable for believing what is right. While the notion of epistemic worth is independently interesting, the main aim is to show that appealing to it provides a response to arguments against the view that truth is the fundamental norm for belief and, thereby, to arguments for the view that knowledge is the fundamental norm for belief. The direction of travel does not only run from ethics to epistemology.

In particular, Timothy Williamson has claimed that the proper context for a modal exercise of imagination is a counterfactual supposition. I critically assess this claim, arguing that a purely conceivability/imaginability-based approach has a key advantage compared to a counterfactual-based one. It can take on board Williamson's insights about the structure of modal imagination while avoiding aspects of counterfactual reasoning which are orthogonal to figuring out metaphysical modality. In assessing whetherAis possible, we creatively devise test scenarios, psychologically and metaphysically aptA-scenarios, which manifest the relevant metaphysical requirements and test them for their compatibility withA. In this exercise, imagination is subject to implicit constraints as Williamson has it, but it is not bound to drawing consequences from minimally altering actuality such as to make room forA.","[Dohrn, Daniel] Univ Milan, Dipartimento Filosofia, Via Festa del Perdono 7, I-20122 Milan, Italy",University of Milan,"Dohrn, D (corresponding author), Univ Milan, Dipartimento Filosofia, Via Festa del Perdono 7, I-20122 Milan, Italy.",Daniel.Dohrn@unimi.it,"Dohrn, Daniel/HZM-5414-2023",,,,,,49,2,2,0,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0031-8116,1573-0883,,PHILOS STUD,Philos.

The former is assumed to be a normal operator (corresponding-semantically-to a binary Kripke relation), while the latter is merely a classical operator (corresponding-semantically-to a neighborhood function). We then define belief, interpreted as maximally plausible possibility, in terms of these two notions: the agent believes phi if (1) she cannot rule out f (that is, it is not the case that she is certain that notsign f), (2) she judges f to be plausible and (3) she does not judge notsign f to beto be plausible. We consider four interaction properties between certainty and plausibility and study how these properties translate into properties of belief (e.g. positive and negative introspection and their converses). We then prove that all the logics considered are minimal logics for the highlighted theorems.

Despite undisputed potential benefits, such systems may also raise problems.

The second (related) issue concerns the assignment of responsibility in cases of failure. The core of the two issues seems to be that understanding and responsibility are concepts that are intrinsically tied to the discursive practice of giving and asking for reasons. The challenge is to find ways to make the outcomes of machine learning algorithms compatible with our discursive practice. This comes down to the claim that we should try to integrate discursive elements into machine learning algorithms.

Whereas the epistemological claims in the case have been extensively analysed conceptually, the strategies and tools from other philosophical disciplines such as analytic philosophy of language, logic and argumentation that Gettier deploys in the case have scarcely received any attention.

Evidence-based medicine (EBM), the most prominent form of foundationalism, has attained wide appeal and acceptance among authorities. It proposes that evidence is the base upon which all clinical decisions should be grounded. Others have countered that the clinical encounter is far too complex for a singular base, and the different factors that impose on a clinical decision cannot be neatly and permanently ranked a priori. By its very nature, this anti-foundationalist outlook has resisted simplistic description, which is perhaps the reason it has not been as popular. In this paper, I provide a survey of the foundationalist and anti-foundationalist debate in medicine and defend anti-foundationalism on the basis that foundationalist approaches are anachronistic, and in the case of evidence-based medicine ultimately confuses inputs (evidence) for consideration in making a judgement with outputs (conclusions). I further propose that virtue ethics is inseparable from anti-foundationalism and conclude that the current infatuation with EBM implies something rather troubling; that physicians cannot be trusted to utilize their extensive training and skills to make reasonable decisions in the best interests of their patients. If this is in fact true, it suggests a crisis in virtue amongst medical professionals.","[Ghinea, Narcyz] Univ Sydney, Sch Publ Hlth, Sydney Hlth Eth, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Ghinea, Narcyz] Univ Sydney, Sydney Law Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Sydney; University of Sydney,"Ghinea, N (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sydney Hlth Eth, Level 1,Bldg 1,Med Fdn Bldg, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",narcyz.ghinea@sydney.edu.au,,"Ghinea, Narcyz/0000-0002-1457-7252",,,,,36,2,2,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1356-1294,1365-2753,,J EVAL CLIN PRACT,J.

Is there a specific value of n that renders this counterfactual true? According to an increasingly influential view, there is. A precursor of the view goes back to the Molinists; more recently it has been inspired by Stalnaker, and versions of it have been advocated by Hawthorne, Bradley, Moss, Schulz, and Stefansson. More generally, I attribute to these authors what I call Counterfactual Plenitude: For any antecedent A, there is a world w(i)such that A & x2610;-> w(i)is true. Moreover, some of these authors are also committed to Primitive Counterfacts Realism: There exist primitive modal facts that serve as truth-makers for counterfactual claims. Call the conjunction of these italicized theses counterfactism. I clarify it and suggest some of its virtues, while ultimately rejecting it. Stefansson's counterfactism is motivated by and targeted at my counterfactual skepticism-I argue that most counterfactuals are false-and counterfactism has various other sources of support. I briefly defend that skepticism, and I seek to undercut those sources of support. I then argue more directly against counterfactism, especially on grounds of its ontological profligacy, and its leading to another kind of skepticism about counterfactuals that I believe is more problematic than my kind. In the process, I discuss how Bradley's multidimensional semantics bears on counterfactism; I offer some new considerations against some central theses regarding conditionals (Conditional Excluded Middle, Stalnaker's Thesis, and Skyrms' Thesis); and I reflect more generally on the epistemology of modality and the choice of primitives in our theorizing.","[Hajek, Alan] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University,"Hájek, A (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",hajek.alan@gmail.com,,"Hajek, Alan/0000-0003-2315-2114",,,,,47,3,3,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0039-7857,1573-0964,,SYNTHESE,Synthese,2020 APR 20,2020,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s11229-020-02643-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11229-020-02643-x,,APR 2020,30,History & Philosophy Of Science; Philosophy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),History & Philosophy of Science; Philosophy,LF5OC,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000527467600003,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is this conjunction of claims - that individuals oppress themselves in virtue of certain normative claims they accept because of their supposed epistemic merits - that marks Foucault's uniquely disturbing contribution to the literature whose diagnostic aim is, with Weber, to understand the oppressive character of modernity, and whose moral aim is, with the Frankfurt School, human liberation. Foucault is also a kind of 'realist' in his approach: he does not offer moral arguments to persuade people that they ought to behave differently than they do, but instead shows people the actual history of the institutions and norms to which they subjugate themselves. This essay explains Foucault's critical and realist project, and concludes with critical reflections on its plausibility.","[Leiter, Brian] Univ Chicago, Ctr Law Philosophy & Human Values, 1111 E 60th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Leiter, B (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Ctr Law Philosophy & Human Values, 1111 E 60th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",bleiter@uchicago.edu,,,,,,,26,0,0,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0020-174X,1502-3923,,INQUIRY,Inquiry-Interdiscip.

Evidence, even if probative and correct, must have a proper foundation. Expert witness testimony must be the product of reliable principles and methods. Prosecutors are not permitted to trick juries into convicting a defendant, even if that defendant is truly guilty. Judges' reasons, and not just the correctness of their holdings, are the engines of precedent. Lawyers are, in short, familiar with the notion that one must be right for the right reasons. And yet the standard epistemic theory of the First Amendment - that the marketplace of ideas is the best test of truth - has generally focused on truth alone, as if all true beliefs must be treated equally. This thin account leaves the epistemic theory vulnerable to withering criticism, especially in a post-truth era. This Article suggests that the epistemic theory of the First Amendment might be reframed around a different value: not truth alone, but knowledge, roughly defined as justified true belief. Philosophers from Plato until the present day have explored what makes knowledge distinct and distinctly valuable; echoes of those efforts can be heard in First Amendment theory and doctrine as well. A knowledge-based account need not limit the protections of free speech to justified true belief, any more than the marketplace model covers only truth, and may even help resolve thorny First Amendment issues like those involving professional speech and institutional deference. The goal of this Article is to provide a richer epistemic account of the First Amendment at a time when it is sorely needed.","[Blocher, Joseph] Duke Law Sch, Law, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Duke University,"Blocher, J (corresponding author), Duke Law Sch, Law, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",,,,,,,,174,6,6,1,2,HARVARD LAW REV ASSOC,CAMBRIDGE,"GANNETT HOUSE, 1511 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02138 USA",0017-811X,2161-976X,,HARVARD LAW REV,Harv.

This paper argues that defeasible infinitism provides a good way to characterize real knowledge and it shows how real knowledge can arise from fallible justification. Then, I argue that there are two ways of interpreting Ernest Sosa's account of real knowledge as belief that is aptly formed and capable of being fully defended. On the one hand, if beliefs are aptly formed only if they have a specific causal etiology, namely that they are efficiently caused fully or partially by virtuous characteristics of the epistemic agent, then Sosa's account falls prey to what I call the problem of the Hazard of Empirical Disconfirmation (HED). The HED problem applies to all forms of causal accounts of real knowledge and is simply that as we gain more empirical knowledge about the causal origins of our true beliefs that are the most highly prized we will discover that they do not always (or even hardly ever) satisfy the required efficient causal constraints. Bluntly put, having sufficiently good reasons for our beliefs might not require that the beliefs have the requisite efficient causal etiology. On the other hand, there is a way of interpreting Sosa's views that does not include an efficient causal prerequisite. That interpretation makes Sosa's account of real knowledge almost identical to defeasible infinitism but expressed in an alternate vocabulary. Such a view is not subject to the HED problem and it can solve the deep problem in epistemology, namely how to get epistemically certain (as opposed to psychologically certain) knowledge from fallible justification.","[Klein, Peter D.] Rutgers State Univ, Philosophy Dept, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Klein, PD (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Philosophy Dept, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",pdklein@scarletmail.rutgers.edu,"Klein, Peter Daniel/AAN-2161-2020","Klein, Peter Daniel/0000-0003-2019-137X",,,,,44,1,1,0,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1742-3600,1750-0117,,EPISTEME-J INDIV SOC,Episteme,DEC,2019,16,4,,,SI,,395,412,,10.1017/epi.2019.33,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/epi.2019.33,,,18,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,JU5GH,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000501703200004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Moreover, there are some reasons to think it should be a counterfactual conditional. First, I defend Williamson's account of the logical form of thought experiments against a competing account offered by Ichikawa and Jarvis. The two accounts have a similar structure, but Williamson's posits a counterfactual conditional where Ichikawa and Jarvis' posits a strict conditional. Williamson's motivation is related to the problem of deviant realizations, and Ichikawa and Jarvis propose to take care of this problem by enriching the content of the thought experiment in the way we enrich the content of a text of fiction. However, this sort of enrichment is also compatible with Williamson's account. I then consider a different view, defended by Malmgren, on which a complex possibility claim exhausts our reasoning on typical thought experiments. I argue that this account, leaving out a conditional, fails to represent an important part of our reasoning with thought experiments. This is brought out by reflection on the relationship between thought experiments and similar actual cases and by reflection on the requirement, formulated by Malmgren herself, that our reasoning should have an adequate level of generality.","[Sgaravatti, Daniele] Univ St Andrews, Philoosoph Res Ctr, Arche, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland",University of St Andrews,"Sgaravatti, D (corresponding author), Univ St Andrews, Philoosoph Res Ctr, Arche, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland.",daniele_sgaravatti@yahoo.it,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-7411,1572-8749,,TOPOI-INT REV PHILOS,Topoi-Int.

This discussion has been prompted, in no small part, by the depth and persistence of disagreement among philosophers on virtually every major theoretical issue in the field. In this paper, I examine the role that the Method of Cases (MoC) - the widespread philosophical method of testing and revising theories by comparing their verdicts against our intuitions in particular cases - plays in creating and sustaining theoretical disagreements in philosophy. Drawing on work from cognitive psychology, I argue that there is a fundamental incompatibility between (a) the structure of the theories that philosophers seek to construct using the MoC and (b) the structure of the concepts on which our case-specific intuitions are based. This incompatibility renders MoC-based philosophical theorizing unable ever to succeed by the very standards of adequacy that it sets for itself. And this, in turn, helps to explain the depth and persistence of theoretical disagreements - and, in certain ways, the lack of progress - in the many areas of philosophy where the MoC plays an important role.","[Suhler, Christopher] Nanyang Technol Univ, Dept Philosophy, 14 Nanyang Dr, Singapore 637332, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University,"Suhler, C (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Dept Philosophy, 14 Nanyang Dr, Singapore 637332, Singapore.",csuhler@gmail.com,,,"Nanyang Technological University College of Humanities, Arts, & Social Sciences [M4081899.100]","Nanyang Technological University College of Humanities, Arts, & Social Sciences","This work was supported by a grant from the Nanyang Technological University College of Humanities, Arts, & Social Sciences (project M4081899.100).",,73,2,2,0,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1878-5158,1878-5166,,REV PHILOS PSYCHOL,Rev.

Moreover, researchers from several fields have argued that developing scientific expertise involves not only the acquisition of knowledge that can be expressed in the form of a sentence, propositional knowledge, but also knowledge that cannot be articulated. This article examines the Mary's room thought experiment proposed by Frank Jackson and applies it to the context of science education. The thought experiment imagines a scientist, Mary, who has learned all the available scientific information about the physical properties of a tomato and the process of colour vision without directly experiencing the fruit. Jackson poses the question of whether Mary will gain new knowledge when she encounters a tomato for the first time. An argument is put forward that propositional and non-propositional knowledge are distinct, and a case is made for the value of non-propositional knowledge in learning science. An analogy is drawn between the scientist in Jackson's thought experiment and a learner in a science classroom who is taught propositional knowledge about a scientific concept without directly experiencing relevant phenomena. It is argued that this approach to teaching fails to develop the learner's non-propositional knowledge. A number of strategies for supporting learners to develop non-propositional knowledge are discussed. It is argued that science educators should consider the phenomenological curriculum, the experiences that students should be introduced to alongside propositional knowledge, in order to develop scientific understanding.","[Brock, Richard; Hay, David] Kings Coll London, Sch Educ Commun & Soc, Waterloo Bridge Wing,Franklin Wilkins Bldg, London SE1 9NH, England",University of London; King's College London,"Brock, R (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, Sch Educ Commun & Soc, Waterloo Bridge Wing,Franklin Wilkins Bldg, London SE1 9NH, England.",richard.brock@kcl.ac.uk,,"Brock, Richard/0000-0003-2497-8030",,,,,144,2,2,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0926-7220,1573-1901,,SCI EDUC-NETHERLANDS,Sci.

Hintikka in Knowledge and belief, Cornell University Press, Ithaca, NY, 1962). But Stalnaker does not, as is common, provide a semantics of attitude ascriptions based on the models he develops of the attitudinal states themselves. This paper begins to explore the prospects for doing so. It argues that a simple but well-motivated approach does not yield the principles of knowledge and belief Stalnaker endorses; and that a modification which does brings with it worries of its own surrounding communication and learnability.

More generally, it is the problem of explaining why true beliefs merely formed on the basis of statistical evidence do not amount to knowledge. Some have thought that the lottery problem can be solved by appeal to a violation of the safety principle for knowledge, i.e., the principle that if S knows that p, not easily would S have believed that p without p being the case. Against the standard safety-based solution, I argue that understanding safe belief as belief that directly covaries with the truth of what is believed in a suitably defined set of possible worlds forces safety theorists to make a series of theoretical choices that ultimately prevent a satisfactory solution to the problem. In this way, I analyze several safety principles that result from such choices-the paper thus gives valuable insights into the nature of safety-and explain why none solves the lottery problem, including their inability to explain away Gettierized lottery cases. On a more positive note, I show that there is a viable solution in terms of safety if we get rid of the unquestioned assumption that safe beliefs directly track the truth. The alternative is a conception of safe belief according to which what safe beliefs directly track is the appropriateness of the circumstances and, indirectly, the truth. The resulting safety principle, I argue, explains why mere statistical evidence is not a safe source of knowledge.","[Broncano-Berrocal, Fernando] Autonomous Univ Madrid, Madrid, Spain",Autonomous University of Madrid,"Broncano-Berrocal, F (corresponding author), Autonomous Univ Madrid, Dept Linguist Log & Philosophy Sci, Madrid, Spain.",fernando.broncano@uam.es,,"Broncano-Berrocal, Fernando/0000-0001-6472-2684","SpanishMinistry for Science, Innovation, and Universities [PGC2018-098805-B-I00]","SpanishMinistry for Science, Innovation, and Universities","SpanishMinistry for Science, Innovation, and Universities, Grant/AwardNumber: Research grant `NewPerspectives on Epistemic Risk' (Ref.

The distinguishing feature of the article is its attempt to provide a relatively concise overview of the background and structure of the case for the inclusivity of research through visual arts practices at doctoral level in the universities, based upon an aesthetic cognitivist position which I hope will support research supervisors and others charged with advocating the viability of practice-based or practice-led doctoral proposals(1) in university cross-disciplinary research degrees' committees.","[Riley, Howard] Univ Wales Trinity St David, Swansea Coll Art, Carmarthen, Dyfed, Wales",University of Wales Trinity St David,"Riley, H (corresponding author), Univ Wales Trinity St David, Swansea Coll Art, Carmarthen, Dyfed, Wales.",howard.riley@btinternet.com,"Riley, Howard/G-1771-2010","Riley, Howard/0000-0002-8682-2587",,,,,24,3,4,0,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1474-0222,1741-265X,,ARTS HUM HIGH EDUC,Arts Hum.

It argues, first, that he underestimates how badly it impacts his view. When knowledge is compartmentalized, it lacks at least one of two essential features of Lewis's account: (a) Elusiveness-familiar skeptical possibilities, when relevant, are incompatible with everyday knowledge. (b) Knowledge is a modality-when a thinker knows that p, there is no relevant possibility where p is false. Lewis proposes compartmentalized knowledge to keep treating knowledge as a modality while mitigating one of its unrealistic epistemological implications: In normal modal epistemic logic (and standard possible world semantics), a thinker always counts as knowing the strongest proposition that follows from the set of all the individual propositions that this thinker knows. Lewis's compartmentalization proposal is that thinkers merely know the conjunctions of propositions that are known in each of, but not across, their compartments. The irony is that in avoiding overblown knowledge the view now allows for thinkers to attend to skeptical error possibilities and yet knowledge is present. The account avoids inflation of knowledge in one sense only to acquire another type of knowledge the view denies subjects can have. This problem motivates an inspection of knowledge accounts whose intra-compartment closure principles are weaker than those that are valid in normal modal-logic. The conclusion is that some formulations of closure can avoid the challenge Lewis's view faces. Nevertheless, even these closure principles pose a barrier-perhaps an implausible barrier-for knowledge of ignorance. Even when the reasoning supporting the lack of knowledge is sound, a subject cannot always know she doesn't know. Interestingly, this obstacle is one that knowledge of knowledge doesn't seem to face.","[Spectre, Levi] Open Univ Israel, Dept Hist Philosophy & Juda Studies, Raanana, Israel",Open University Israel,"Spectre, L (corresponding author), Open Univ Israel, Dept Hist Philosophy & Juda Studies, Raanana, Israel.",levi.spectre@gmail.com,"Spectre, Levi/AFK-0559-2022; Spectre, Levi/AAF-7533-2022","Spectre, Levi/0000-0002-2913-346X",,,,,19,3,3,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0031-8116,1573-0883,,PHILOS STUD,Philos.

One controversial aspect of the proposed account is that it is non-reductive.

But how do non-human primates represent others' knowledge states? Researchers have recently proposed that non-human primates form awareness relations to attribute objectively true information to other minds, as opposed to human-like representations that track others' ignorance or false belief states. We present the first explicit test of the awareness relations hypothesis by examining when rhesus macaques' understanding of other agents' knowledge falters. In Experiment 1, monkeys watched an agent observe a piece of fruit (the target object) being hidden in one of two boxes. While the agent's view was occluded, either the fruit moved out of its box and directly back into it, or the box containing the fruit opened and immediately closed. We found that monkeys looked significantly longer when the agent reached incorrectly rather than correctly after the box's movement, but not after the fruit's movement. This result suggests that monkeys did not expect the agent to know the fruit's location when it briefly and arbitrarily moved while the agent could not see it, but did expect the agent to know the fruit's location when only the box moved while the agent could not see it. In Experiment 2, we replicated and extended both findings with a larger sample, a different target object, and opposite directions of motion in the test trials. These findings suggest that monkeys reason about others' knowledge of objects by forming awareness relations which are disrupted by arbitrary spatial manipulation of the target object while an agent has no perceptual access to it.","[Horschler, Daniel J.; MacLean, Evan L.] Univ Arizona, Sch Anthropol, POB 210030, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Santos, Laurie R.] Yale Univ, Dept Psychol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Horschler, Daniel J.] Univ Arizona, Cognit Sci Grad Interdisciplinary Program, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA; [MacLean, Evan L.] Univ Arizona, Dept Psychol, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA; [MacLean, Evan L.] Univ Arizona, Cognit Sci Program, Tucson, AZ 85719 USA",University of Arizona; Yale University; University of Arizona; University of Arizona; University of Arizona,"Horschler, DJ (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Sch Anthropol, POB 210030, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",horschler@email.arizona.edu,"MacLean, Evan L/H-2454-2011","MacLean, Evan/0000-0001-7595-662X",NIMH [R01MH096875]; NCRR [CM-5-P40FtR003640-13]; Emil W.

J,"Rotila, V",,,,"Rotila, Viorel",,,Is Religion a Necessary Condition for the Emergence of Knowledge? Some Explanatory Hypotheses,POSTMODERN OPENINGS,,,English,Article,,,,,,religion; emergence of knowledge; evolutionary path of knowledge,EVOLUTION,"By using the general investigation framework offered by the cognitive science of religion (CSR), I analyse religion as a necessary condition for the evolutionary path of knowledge. The main argument is the paradox of the birth of knowledge: in order to get to the meaning of the part, a sense context is needed; but a sense of the whole presupposes the sense (meaning) of the parts. Religion proposes solutions to escape this paradox, based on the imagination of sense (meaning) contexts, respectively closures of these contexts through meta-senses. What is important is the practical effectiveness of solutions proposed by religion, taking into account the costs of faith and the costs of the absence of religious belief. The hypothesis has the following consequences: religion is a necessary condition for the initial evolution of knowledge and the emergence of religion is determined by the evolution of knowledge. The continuation of the solving of paradox is a Bayesian one, using explorations: a sense of the whole allows cognitive arrangements of the parties, Which in turn open the possibility of a rearrangement of the whole. The contribution of religion to the emergence of sense (meaning) could be governed by the rule: any map of the world is more useful than no map; any meaning (of life) is better than no meaning. The human mind fills the perceptual and cognitive gaps, some (religious) filling solutions being true vault keys of the entire cognitive construction called the world. Knowledge is conditioned by the existence of an organized context, as the cosmos created by religion by means of explanatory meta-theories supports knowledge by closing the cognitive context and using meaning networks. The proposed analysis is consistent with a redefinition of rationality from the perspective of evolution: the importance and relevance of knowledge is determined by its practical outcome - survival. In the context of useful fictions, it does not matter what God actually does, but what we have done by believing in God. Existence has provided a pragmatic verification of the cognitive solutions that underlie the survival strategies promoted by religions.","[Rotila, Viorel] Dunarea de Jos Univ Galati, Galati, Romania",Dunarea De Jos University Galati,"Rotila, V (corresponding author), Dunarea de Jos Univ Galati, Galati, Romania.",viorelrotila@yahoo.com,"Rotilă, Viorel/B-6760-2016",,,,,,29,0,1,0,2,LUMEN PUBLISHING HOUSE,IASI,"TEPES VODA, NO2, IASI, IASI, 00000, ROMANIA",2068-0236,2069-9387,,POSTMOD OPEN,Postmod.

Our main contribution will be to identify one heretofore undiscussed way knowledge could be valuable, but isn't-specifically, having value to someone other than the understander. We suggest that it is a desideratum on an account of understanding that understanding have the specified type of value; our basis for this claim will come from recent work in cognitive psychology. This desideratum can then be used to measure the success of various accounts of understanding. We argue that accounts of understanding that have a particular structure will predict (and perhaps explain) why understanding has that sort of value. For good measure, we then engage in a bit of a literature review, investigating which extant accounts of understanding satisfy this desideratum (spoiler: some do and some don't).","[Wilkenfeld, Daniel A.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Hist & Philosophy Sci, 4200 Fifth Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Johnson, Christa M.] Calif State Univ Long Beach, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; California State University System; California State University Long Beach,"Wilkenfeld, DA (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Hist & Philosophy Sci, 4200 Fifth Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",dawilk@gmail.com,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0925-4560,1572-8587,,J GEN PHILOS SCI,J.

This position naturally assumes that varieties of target beliefs involved in typical Gettier cases are all JTBs, namely, unified beliefs which are simultaneously justified and true. But I do not think this is true. Conversely, every target belief in typical Gettier cases should be cashed out as one or more beliefs, none of which is a genuine JTB. In short, there is no JTB in Gettier's JTB-hostile vignettes at all. Hence, no matter whether the JTB account of knowledge is correct or not, Gettier cases are not really relevant to it. In addition, although I agree to Mizrahi's (Logos Episteme 7(1):31-44, 2016) general observation that face-values of target beliefs cannot be taken for granted in all Gettier cases, I have made a further claim that there is no cross-board methodology to disambiguate the target beliefs in all Gettier cases.","[Xu, Yingjin] Fudan Univ, Sch Philosophy, 220 Handan Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Fudan University,"Xu, YJ (corresponding author), Fudan Univ, Sch Philosophy, 220 Handan Rd, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",yjxu@fudan.edu.cn,,,National Foundation of Social Sciences of P.

However, this goal is infrequently realized, and most barriers are unknown. Discussion between philosophers, clinicians, and researchers can assist in confronting the epistemic and moral basis of health care, with benefits to all. The aim of this paper is to describe what shared decision-making is, discuss its necessary conditions, and develop a definition that can be used in practice to support excellence in maternity care. Discussion between the authors, with backgrounds in philosophy, clinical maternity care, health care management, and maternity care research, assisted the team to confront established norms in maternity care and challenge the epistemic and moral basis of decision-making for caesarean section. The team concluded that shared decision-making must start in pregnancy and continue throughout labour and birth, with equality in discourse facilitated by the clinician. Clinicians have a duty of care for the adequacy of women's knowledge, which can only be fulfilled when relevant knowledge is offered freely and when personal beliefs and biases that may impinge on decision-making (defeaters) are disclosed. Informed consent is not shared decision-making. Key barriers include existing cultural norms of the doctor knows best and patient acquiescence that prevent defeaters being acknowledged and discussed and can lead to legal challenges, overuse of medical intervention and, in some areas, obstetric violence. Shared decision-making in maternity care can thus be defined as an enquiry by clinician and expectant woman aimed at deciding upon a course of care or none, which takes the form of a dialogue within which the clinician fulfils their duty of care to the client's knowledge by making available their complete knowledge (based on all types of evidence) and expertise, including an exposition of any relevant and recognized potential defeaters.

I claim that modal conditions, particularly sensitivity and safety, are not necessary for knowledge. I do this by noting that the problem cases for both conditions point to a problem that cannot be fixed even by a revised similarity ranking or ordering of worlds. I offer as groundwork a set theoretical analysis of the profiles of the problem cases for safety and sensitivity.

This is the main thesis of this paper, which has three sections. In section 1 I argue, following a pragmatic reading of Gettier, that agents on their own lights cannot tell the difference between what they know and what they believe that they know. The reason lies on the pragmatic peculiarities of normative notions, which according to Brandom's normative expressivism amount to saying that first-person epistemic claims lack the required complexity to ground a complete contrasting analysis of the concepts of knowledge and belief. Section 2 deals with the norms of assertion and elaborates in more classical terms something that follows from Brandom's treatment of assertions, i.e. that assertions are expressions of belief that must be taken as knowledge claims. Finally, in section 3, I propose to explain the link between third person ascriptions and first person avowals by borrowing one of Ramsey hints on truth ascriptions to derive the role of the latter from that of the former. First-person epistemic claims, I suggest, are essentially the result of reactive actions, being their role dependent upon the functioning of third-person attributions.","[Jose Frapolli, Maria] Univ Granda, Granada, Spain; [Jose Frapolli, Maria] Univ Granada, Dept Filosofia 1, Campus Cartuja S-N, E-18071 Granada, Spain",University of Granada,"Frápolli, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Granda, Granada, Spain.;Frápolli, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Dept Filosofia 1, Campus Cartuja S-N, E-18071 Granada, Spain.",frapolli@ugr.es,"Frapolli, Maria Jose/B-2067-2016","Frapolli, Maria Jose/0000-0002-4375-3331",European Commission under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant [653056]; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [FFI2016-80088-P]; Unidad de Excelencia FiloLab (University of Granada); Marie Curie Actions (MSCA) [653056] Funding Source: Marie Curie Actions (MSCA),European Commission under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Grant; Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); Unidad de Excelencia FiloLab (University of Granada); Marie Curie Actions (MSCA)(Marie Curie Actions),"Many colleagues have read drafts of this paper and attended events in which I have presented it.

In fact, what Brandom seems to do is further refine Wittgenstein's vocabulary by specifying the game as the game of giving and asking for reasons and rules as the rules of inference. By replacing the plurality of games with the one and only game, though, Brandom also lays the ground for a possible discord. This relates particularly to the cognitive significance of different forms of human experience, such as music or art in general, which are treated by Wittgenstein as language games despite their being rather independent of claims and commitments and despite their utterly lacking the representational dimension. In my paper, I will show that with respect to these objections (as phrased, e.g., by Andrew Bowie), one can argue that Brandom is in fact true to Wittgenstein's instruction to always read his Investigations against his Tractatus. The general idea is to look at the game and picture metaphor as parts of a single concept that both philosophers work on together by going back to the very idealist concept of reflexivity or self consciousness.","[Kolman, Vojtech] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Arts, Jan Palach Sq 1-2, Prague 11638 1, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Kolman, V (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Fac Arts, Jan Palach Sq 1-2, Prague 11638 1, Czech Republic.",vojtech.kolman@ff.cuni.cz,"Kolman, Vojtěch/M-5867-2017",,European Regional Development Fund-Project Creativity and Adaptability as Conditions of the Success of Europe in an Interrelated World [CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_019/0000734],European Regional Development Fund-Project Creativity and Adaptability as Conditions of the Success of Europe in an Interrelated World,This work was supported by the European Regional Development Fund-Project Creativity and Adaptability as Conditions of the Success of Europe in an Interrelated World (No. CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_019/0000734).,,25,0,0,0,3,"UNIV SALAMANCA, EDICIONES",SALAMANCA,"SECRETARIADO PUBLICACIONES & INTERCAMBIO CIENTIFICO, PATIO DE ESCUELAS,1, APARTADO 325, SALAMANCA, 37080, SPAIN",,2254-0601,,DISPUTATIO-SPAIN,Disputatio,JUN,2019,8,9,,,SI,,,,,,,,,22,Philosophy,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Philosophy,KH7RU,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000510848100015,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, we provide a topological semantics for belief, in particular, for Stalnaker's notion of belief defined as 'epistemic possibility of knowledge', in terms of the closure of the interior operator on extremally disconnected spaces. This semantics extends the standard topological interpretation of knowledge (as the interior operator) with a new topological semantics for belief. We prove that the belief logic KD45 is sound and complete with respect to the class of extremally disconnected spaces and we compare our approach to a different topological setting in which belief is interpreted in terms of the derived set operator. We also study (static) belief revision as well as belief dynamics by providing a topological semantics for conditional belief and belief update modalities, respectively. Our setting based on extremally disconnected spaces, however, encounters problems when extended with dynamic updates. We then propose a solution consisting in interpreting belief in a similar way based on hereditarily extremally disconnected spaces, and axiomatize the belief logic of hereditarily extremally disconnected spaces. Finally, we provide a complete axiomatization the logic of conditional belief and knowledge, as well as a complete axiomatization of the corresponding dynamic logic.","[Baltag, Alexandru; Bezhanishvili, Nick; Ozgun, Aybuke; Smets, Sonja] Univ Amsterdam, ILLC, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Özgün, A (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, ILLC, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",thealexandrubaltag@gmail.com; n.bezhanishvili@uva.nl; a.ozgun@uva.nl; s.j.l.smets@uva.nl,,"Ozgun, Aybuke/0000-0003-2523-0518; Smets, Sonja/0000-0001-8019-0171; Bezhanishvili, Nick/0009-0005-6692-5051",Shota Rustaveli National Science Foundation [DI-2016-25]; European Research Council (ERC CoG) [681404]; European Research Council under the European Community's 7th Framework Programme/ERC [283963],Shota Rustaveli National Science Foundation; European Research Council (ERC CoG)(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council under the European Community's 7th Framework Programme/ERC,"Nick Bezhanishvili was partially supported by Shota Rustaveli National Science Foundation grant #DI-2016-25.

I discuss how Mackie came to develop this distinction and how central ideas of his philosophy are based on it. Using the examples of Mackie's moral skepticism and his work on Locke's theory of perception I show how his methodology opens the door to error theories but can also support more positive claims. Finally, I put Mackie's methodology in a historical perspective and argue that in cases like the Gettier debate, we can use it to cast light on the vagueness of the underlying methodology in some philosophical debates.","[Lossau, Tammo] Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",Johns Hopkins University,"Lossau, T (corresponding author), Johns Hopkins Univ, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA.",,"Lossau, Tammo/ABE-4283-2021","Lossau, Tammo/0000-0002-8730-9590",,,,,29,0,0,0,0,BRILL,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",2666-4283,2666-4275,,HIST PHILO LOG ANAL,Hist.

The final section of the paper relates the proposed sensitivity- and safety-based account of corroboration to an explanation-based account.","[Godden, David] Michigan State Univ, Dept Philosophy, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Godden, D (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Philosophy, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",dgodden@msu.edu,"Godden, David/S-3313-2019","Godden, David/0000-0002-4870-6331",,,,,42,1,1,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0353-5150,1874-6349,,ACTA ANAL,Acta Anal.-Int.

In this paper I propose a reconciliationist solution to the acquaintance debate: while aesthetic knowledge can be had via testimony, aesthetic judgment requires acquaintance with the artwork. I develop this solution by situating it within a virtue aesthetics framework based on Ernest Sosa's virtue epistemology. I go on to apply the solution to the debates on moral testimony and expert testimony. An interesting variant on Gettier cases emerges: cases in which subjects have knowledge, but it has been formed by the wrong competence.","[Ransom, Madeleine] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Ransom, M (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",,,"Ransom, Madeleine/0000-0002-4927-9183",,,,,51,15,18,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0031-8205,1933-1592,,PHILOS PHENOMEN RES,Philos.

Considering that learning is heavily focused on the acquisition of knowledge, it is important to examine the individual and systematic implications of these types of knowledge. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the impact on overall educational performance as a result of engaging with technology subjects at post-primary level. Sample: A five year cohort study was designed to gather longitudinal data from a total sample of 1761 pupils' grades from the Irish Leaving Certificate examination. The sample was distributed across four schools. Design and methods: Grades from the Irish Leaving Certificate were selected because the examination is considered high stakes as it serves as the country's primary mechanism for matriculation into third-level education. Individual examinations are designed externally to schools by a government body ensuring the validity of each examination in capturing the holistic interpretation subject syllabi. Finally, a points system is used to score each examination facilitating comparisons between subjects. Results: The results show that pupils who study the technology subjects are statistically significantly less likely to perform well overall in comparison to pupils who study science and mathematics subjects. They also show that for pupils who study the technology subjects, those subjects are statistically significantly likely to be their best performing subjects. Conclusions: Due to the array of variables impacting subject selection, a definitive causal explanation cannot be deduced from the data for these results. However, it is possible to infer that the variance in knowledge types between the science and technology subjects has an impact on the results. A case is made that a compulsory technological component should be incorporated into educational curricula to provide a comprehensive and general education and to facilitate the holistic development of pupils.","[Buckley, Jeffrey; Seery, Niall] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Learning Engn Sci, Stockholm, Sweden; [Seery, Niall] Athlone Inst Technol, Off President, Westmeath, Ireland; [Power, Jason] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Phelan, Joseph] Univ Limerick, Sch Educ, Limerick, Ireland",Royal Institute of Technology; Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest; Michigan Technological University; University of Limerick,"Buckley, J (corresponding author), KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Learning Engn Sci, Stockholm, Sweden.",jbuckley@kth.se,"Buckley, Jeffrey/U-9752-2019; Phelan, Joseph/GWC-8543-2022; Power, Jason/HTT-4216-2023","Buckley, Jeffrey/0000-0002-8292-5642; Phelan, Joseph/0000-0002-4835-6589; Power, Jason/0000-0002-9082-7380; Seery, Niall/0000-0003-4199-4753",,,,,53,7,8,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0263-5143,1470-1138,,RES SCI TECHNOL EDUC,Res.

SOME THOUGHTS ON EXPERIMENTAL PHILOSOPHY AND AESTHETICS,RIVISTA DI ESTETICA,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"In this paper I will discuss some issues related to a recent trend in experimental philosophy (or Ex-Phi), and try to show the reasons of its late (and scarce) involvement with aesthetics, compared to other areas of philosophical investigation. In order to do this, it is first necessary to ask how an autonomous experimental philosophy of aesthetics could be related to the long-standing tradition of psychological experimental aesthetics. After distinguishing between a 'narrow' and a 'broad' approach of experimental philosophy, I will then make a distinction between topics in aesthetics pertaining to perceptual and cognitive processes, and traditional issues involved in the analysis of general and culturally-laden concepts. The narrow program of experimental philosophy, focused on the investigation of folk intuitions, is particularly effective only when two general conditions are met: the use of hypothetical scenarios (testing of thought experiments) and the heuristic role of folk intuitions in drawing philosophically relevant conclusions. I will argue that, when aesthetics is concerned, these requirements are not easily met. These difficulties notwithstanding, I will support a pluralistic view where aesthetics is revealed as an instructive example of how experimental approaches and traditional 'armchair' philosophy integrate, and enrich each other.","[Arielli, Emanuele] Univ Iuav Venezia, Dipartimento Cultura Progetto, Venice, Italy",IUAV University Venice,"Arielli, E (corresponding author), Univ Iuav Venezia, Dipartimento Cultura Progetto, Venice, Italy.",arielli@iuav.it,,,,,,,59,0,0,0,1,ROSENBERG & SELLIER,TURIN,"VIA ANDREA DORIA 14, 10123 TURIN, ITALY",0035-6212,,,RIV ESTET,Riv.

Their formulations beget probabilistic musings, which beget all sorts of paradoxes, which in turn beget radical reconceptions and proposals for reform. The theoretical radicals argue that the law needs some basic reconception such as recognizing the aim of legal proof as not at all a search for truth but rather the production of an acceptable result, or that the law needs some shattering reform such as greatly heightening the civil standard of proof on each part of the case to ensure a more-likely-than-not overall result. This Article refutes all those baroque rereadings. It shows that the standards of proof properly understood on the law's own terms without a probabilistic overlay, work just fine. The law tells factfinders to compare their degree of belief in the alleged fact to their degree of contradictory disbelief. Obeying that instruction resolves mathematically the paradoxes that traditional probability theory creates for itself. Most surprising, the burden of proof by which the proponent must prove all the elements and the opponent need disprove only one, does not produce an asymmetry between the parties. The law's standards of proof need no drastic reconception or reform, because the law knew what it was doing all along. It deals with factual beliefs in a world that will remain uncertain, not with the odds of the facts becoming certain. And the well-established mathematics of beliefs are not the mathematics of odds.","[Clermont, Kevin M.] Cornell Univ, Law, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Clermont, KM (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Law, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",,,"Clermont, Kevin/0000-0001-6414-4415",,,,,263,6,6,0,2,CORNELL LAW REVIEW,ITHACA,"CORNELL LAW SCHOOL, ITHACA, NY 14853-4901 USA",0010-8847,,,CORNELL LAW REV,Cornell Law Rev.,,2019,104,6,,,,,1457,1512,,,,,,56,Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Government & Law,NO1PP,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000569259000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the paper were analyzed basic strategies of solving the Gettier problem. One way is to save the analysis of knowledge by changing the elements in order to avoid the Gettier problem. There are three possible ways of doing so: adding new elements to the justification, changing the justification on the other criteria or strengthen the justification in such a way, that it would resolve any possible Gettier cases. For each strategy analysis of the theories of knowledge is given. In the paper idea of the inescapability of Gettier cases for analysis of knowledge was supported by the argumentation of Linda Zagzebski. In that ground, the analysis of knowledge was refuted. From that perspective, two of the most influenced ways of answering the question what is knowledge was proposed. First, the irreducible theory of knowledge, where knowledge is a mere state of the mind. Second, rejection existence of the universal invariant of the knowledge in every case. There are multiple senses of what the knowledge is and none of them is prior to other. The author lives as the open question the right way to think about the knowledge. In the closing part of the paper, the author presents a perspective critique of the knowledge problem as the project of overrated significance, and argues for a need to create new arguments that supporting that problem.","[Demin, Timofey S.] St Petersburg State Univ, 5 Mendeleevskaya Line, St Petersburg 199034, Russia",Saint Petersburg State University,"Demin, TS (corresponding author), St Petersburg State Univ, 5 Mendeleevskaya Line, St Petersburg 199034, Russia.",detimofei@gmail.com,,,,,,,30,0,1,0,1,RUSSIAN ACAD SCIENCES-INST PHILOSOPHY,MOSCOW,"UL VOLHONKA, DOM 14-1, STR 5, MOSCOW, 119991, RUSSIA",1811-833X,2311-7133,,EPISTEMOL PHILOS SCI,Epistemol.

The roots of this philosophical branch can be traced back to the one of the first theoretical consideration about the sciences of the artificial (Simon 1996 [1969]) which in opposition to natural sciences should deal with non-natural entities which populates our world, namely artifacts. These considerations have been extended and discussed starting from a research program aimed at changing the route within philosophy of technology: the so called empirical turn in philosophy of technology (Kroes, Meijers 2000). Following this, two issues have been debated in the subsequent years: the first is related to the definition of 'design' and to the philosophical questions that arise (like the reference of design terms and their truth-value); the second is a problem of demarcation between science and design (are these two activities different?). The aim of the article is presenting an overview of the debate and showing some possible future developments for the philosophy of design.",,,,,,,,,,,40,0,0,0,0,ROSENBERG & SELLIER,TURIN,"VIA ANDREA DORIA 14, 10123 TURIN, ITALY",0035-6212,,,RIV ESTET,Riv.

A patient is waiting in the clinic room for the diagnosis result to decide whether he needs brain surgery for his medical conditions. After SaMD processed, the result shows that the patient is classified into the highrisk group with 99.9% of death rates and needs brain surgery immediately. But the result is opposite to your diagnosis that the patient needs not the surgery. Will you, as a physician in this scenario, object the result that SaMD has made? Theoretically, Human should be the one who determines all the decisions and takes AI's results for reference only, as the GDPR Article 22 presumes. But quite the opposite, Al's result has greater influences on Human than we thought. In this paper, I explore the tension between AI's decision and human decision from the Epistemological perspectives, i.e. to justify the reasons behind the positive human beliefs in AI. My conclusion is that positive human beliefs in AI are because we misidentified AI as a general technology, and only if we can recognize their differences correctly, then the requirement of Human in the loop in the GDPR Article 22 can have its meaning and function.","[Ku, Chang-Yun] Acad Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan",Academia Sinica - Taiwan,"Ku, CY (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.",,,,,,,,27,0,0,1,6,INFONIA,BUDAPEST,"MUEGYETEM RKP 9 II EMELET 210, BUDAPEST, 1111, HUNGARY",1587-8694,,,INF TARSAD,Inf.

The quest for knowledge gears towards a better understanding of man and his environment as this is strictly part of his inclination and nature to do so in order to promote social change. The essence of knowledge is to liberate and expand the horizons of intelligence of the people, which is aimed at mobilising them towards a patriotic zeal to transforming their society. It is this quest for knowledge that allows human beings from diverse backgrounds to understand one another through inter-cultural communication. An attempt to understand and acquire knowledge in traditional (Western) epistemology demands that three conditions must be met and satisfied. They are: what we claim to know must be true; we must believe that thing we claim to know; and we must have evidence for believing that thing we claim to know. This was the basis for certainty in knowledge until Gettier's sledge hammer destroyed the whole edifice of Western epistemology. In inter-cultural debates and analyses, knowledge is sacrosanct but there is the tyranny today of making Western form of knowledge by the interpretative community as the only means by which problems of humanity could be adequately examined and resolved without recourse to knowledge from diverse cultural backgrounds. This paper, therefore, argues for the acceptance of cultural knowledge as alternative to Western hegemonisation in the quest for making humanity a reality in this contemporary age essentially as it affects intercultural debates and encounters. Hence, it is expected that this paper will initiate a new trend in making inter-cultural encounters less cumbersome through the acceptance of cultural knowledge from societies of the Global South.","[Olatunji, Felix O.] Ladoke Akintola Univ Technol, Philosophy Unit, Dept Gen Studies, Ogbomosho, Nigeria; [Olatunji, Felix O.] Osun State Univ, Dept Philosophy, Ikire Campus, Ikire, Nigeria; [Bature, Anthony, I] Fed Univ, Dept Philosophy & Religious Studies, Wukari, Taraba State, Nigeria",,"Olatunji, FO (corresponding author), Ladoke Akintola Univ Technol, Philosophy Unit, Dept Gen Studies, Ogbomosho, Nigeria.;Olatunji, FO (corresponding author), Osun State Univ, Dept Philosophy, Ikire Campus, Ikire, Nigeria.",felixolatunji28@gmail.com; Abature23@gmail.com,"OLATUNJI, Felix O./AAJ-5831-2020",,,,,,15,0,0,0,3,ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA UNIV IASI FAC PHILOSOPHY & SOCIAL-POLITICAL SCIENCES,IASI,"11, CAROL I BOULEVARD, IASI, 700506, ROMANIA",2069-1025,2248-3446,,AGATHOS,Agathos,,2019,10,2,,,,,79,94,,,,,,16,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,JJ0ZO,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000493890300006,View Full Record in Web of Science

On one side are those who argue that philosophers do rely on intuitions as evidence; on the other side are those who deny any such role for philosophical intuitions. This paper argues that both sides of this debate are partially right and partially wrong. Intuitive judgments do not, as psychological states, function as evidence in most well-known philosophical thought experiments. Philosophers nevertheless strongly depend upon these intuitive judgments. Where both sides go awry is in assuming that the importance of intuitive judgments rests solely upon their role as evidence.

These rules prohibit more efficient means, and are accepted because they make the activity possible (lusory attitude). I argue these conditions are not jointly sufficient. The starting point for the argument is the idea that goals, means and attitudes can pick out their content in different ways. They can involve a direct reference ('crossing this specific finish line'), or a description that picks out something ('crossing a line on the track after running 100 m'). I provide cases in which one's attitudes, accepted goals or accepted means pick out their content by a description such that the person does not play a game, even if Suits's conditions are satisfied. I show that this demands an epistemic condition for playing a game that also applies to commitment based accounts. Finally, I discuss what such an epistemic condition could be. I argue that the condition does not require personal knowledge of all goals and means, but merely enough epistemic access that the goal and permissible means can guide one's behavior safely enough. This might be satisfied by social extensions, such as access to tools (e.g. a rulebook) or other people (e.g. referees).","[Schwengerer, Lukas] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Philosophy Psychol & Language Sci, Dugald Stewart Bldg,3 Charles St, Edinburgh EH8 9AD, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Schwengerer, L (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Sch Philosophy Psychol & Language Sci, Dugald Stewart Bldg,3 Charles St, Edinburgh EH8 9AD, Midlothian, Scotland.",Lukas.Schwengerer@gmail.com,,"Schwengerer, Lukas/0000-0002-2653-0988",,,,,28,2,2,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-1321,1751-133X,,SPORT ETHICS PHILOS,Sport Ethics Philos.,,2019,13,3-4,,,,,293,306,,10.1080/17511321.2018.1515977,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17511321.2018.1515977,,,14,Ethics,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Social Sciences - Other Topics,JP1TU,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000498055300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, many patients refrain from the option that their physician believes to be best, and many physicians worry that their patients make irrational healthcare decisions, hindering their ability to provide efficient healthcare for their patients. Some philosophers have proposed a solution to this problem: they advocate that physicians nudge their patients to steer them towards their physician's preferred option. A nudge is any influence designed to predictably alter a person's behavior without limiting their options or giving them reasons to act. Proponents of nudging contend that nudges are consistent with obtaining informed consent.

His Advice to Christian Philosophers (1983) was the turning point in the history of philosophical theology. In his Advice, Plantinga talks about how best to be a Christian in philosophy. He suggests that Christian intellectuals should become more autonomous from the rest of the philosophical world, display more unity, and express greater Christian self-confidence. This advice, however, is addressed not to just any intellectual of a Christian affiliation. He addresses them to those (1) who have graduated from a conservative Christian college, (2) who have obtained a PhD in philosophy, and (3) who continue their career as professional philosophers. That means that the person should be well acquainted with the traditional Christian doctrine and practice, should be well versed in the contemporary analytic philosophy, and should be an acknowledged member of the established philosophical community. Thus, it would be a mistake to apply Plantinga's Advice to a person who does not meet all of the three requirements. The present day situation in Russia shows a dramatic shortfall of intellectuals who satisfy all the three Plantinga's conditions. It is still premature for Russian Christian philosophers to become autonomous from the rest of the philosophical community, to establish Christian philosophical clusters, and to display Christian self-confidence in the face of the non-theistic majority. Philosophical theology in Russia is currently in its pre-Plantingan phase. In order to improve this situation, the author suggests reversing Plantinga's advice into their opposites. Russian Christian philosophers ought to learn how to operate within the broad philosophical community. They should familiarize themselves with the contemporary analytic philosophy and its methods, and they should become acknowledged members of the established professional circles. Then, and only then, philosophical theology in Russia can enter its post-Plantingan era.","[Butakov, Pavel A.] SB RAS, Inst Philosophy & Law, Novosibirsk, Russia","Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Philosophy & Law, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences","Butakov, PA (corresponding author), SB RAS, Inst Philosophy & Law, Novosibirsk, Russia.",pavelbutakov@academ.org,"Butakov, Pavel/J-3410-2018","Butakov, Pavel/0000-0001-8133-1626",,,,,10,0,0,0,0,TOMSK STATE UNIV,TOMSK,"LENIN AVE, 36, TOMSK, 634050, RUSSIA",1998-863X,2311-2395,,VESTN TOMSK U-FILOS,Vestn.

This is because the said case fails to satisfy the truth condition, and thus is not a case of JTB at all. We demonstrate this claim using the framework of Donnellan's distinction between the referential and attributive uses of definite descriptions. Accordingly, the truth value of Smith's proposition The man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket partly depends on how Smith uses the definite description the man who will get the job when he utters the proposition. Since, upon uttering the proposition, Smith has in mind a particular individual, namely Jones, and not just whoever will fit the attribute specified in the definite description, Smith uses the definite description referentially. And so when it turns out that it is Smith who eventually gets the job, the definite description fails to refer to Jones as intended by Smith, thereby making Smith's proposition false. To think that Smith's proposition is still true, in this regard, is to use the definite description attributively-that it is about whoever will fit the definite description. Apparently, when Gettier claims that Smith's proposition is still true, to demonstrate that it is a case of JTB, he, in effect, imposes his attributive understanding of Smith's usage of the definite description on Smith's own epistemic situation.","[Jose, Joseph Martin M.; Mabaquiao, Napoleon M., Jr.] De La Salle Univ, Dept Philosophy, Manila, Philippines",De La Salle University,"Jose, JMM (corresponding author), De La Salle Univ, Dept Philosophy, Manila, Philippines.",,,,,,,,28,1,1,0,0,"UNIV SANTO TOMAS, FAC ARTS & LETTERS",MANILA,"RM 109, MAIN BLDG, ESPANA, MANILA, 1015, PHILIPPINES",1908-7330,,,KRITIKE,Kritike,DEC,2018,12,2,,,,,91,108,,,,,,18,Philosophy,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Philosophy,HF7WI,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000454452200006,View Full Record in Web of Science

The ontology of discursive space is based on the idea of discourse by Foucault. Discourse, being a language phenomenon, is a form of existence of knowledge. The discursive space is a representation of knowledge and can be interpreted as the system of acquiring this knowledge. This space is connected with the world of facts by a relationship of supervenience, which can be interpreted as a flow of knowledge. At the same time, the existence of the world of facts (world of affairs) assumes that it covers all phenomena and processes, and therefore, necessarily, also the discursive space. Hence, this space is not a separate system but a system that emerges from the world in order to allow the gathering of specific knowledge about it. Treating the discursive space as one of the possible cognitive systems, one can imagine other systems of knowledge that emerge from the world (the whole), as parts subordinated to particular goals (the use of knowledge), which can have a multilevel character. The flow of knowledge on the border of such a system and the whole of it can be interpreted as information. This paper tries to justify this possibility, which could lead to a general model of the flow of the knowledge.","[Maciag, Rafal] Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Culture, PL-30348 Krakow, Poland",Jagiellonian University,"Maciag, R (corresponding author), Jagiellonian Univ, Inst Culture, PL-30348 Krakow, Poland.",rafal.maciag@uj.edu.pl,"Maciag, Rafal/S-6549-2016","Maciag, Rafal/0000-0003-1812-3538",,,,,55,3,3,0,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2409-9287,,PHILOSOPHIES,Philosophies,DEC,2018,3,4,,,,,,,34,10.3390/philosophies3040034,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/philosophies3040034,,,18,History & Philosophy Of Science; Philosophy,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),History & Philosophy of Science; Philosophy,VJ6QV,,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-07-12,WOS:000616406200010,View Full Record in Web of Science

J,"Tillson, J",,,,"Tillson, John",,,Might Knowledge Be Insertable?,EDUCATIONAL THEORY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Can we coherently conceive of our having knowledge inserted into our minds, bypassing forms of knowledge acquisition hitherto relied on? In this article, John Tillson contends that there is value in giving serious consideration to this question. First, insofar as technology develops apace, it is wise to start thinking about how we would use it before its uses are available to us lest we should unreflectively abuse it. Second, even though having knowledge inserted might turn out to be physically impossible, its metaphysical possibility would still make reflecting on its desirability fruitful, since evaluating this will help us to better understand what it is that we value about education and about knowledge. While handling practical knowledge and theoretical knowledge (or knowledge how and knowledge that) somewhat separately, Tillson argues that, for each, insertion is conceivable. He contends that if (a) we seem to be able to imagine inserting knowledge, (b) our seeming to be able to imagine it survives extended critical reflection, and (c) we can elaborate what it would consist of with plausible detail, then we have defeasible reason for thinking that inserting knowledge is in fact metaphysically possible. In the first section, Tillson begins by motivating the question, next briefly considers an imaginary scenario presented in the film The Matrix as an example of what is meant by implanting or inserting knowledge, and then fleshes out the scenario with some more plausible details to help make the case for its coherent conceivability. In the second section, he discusses five objections to the thesis, so as to subject the case to extended critical reflection. These include arguments that inserting knowledge requires inserting justification, but that justification cannot be inserted; that the possibility of inserting false beliefs undermines the possibility of self-trust, which is crucial to knowledge; that inserted content has the wrong causal history to count as knowledge; and that inserted knowledge would lack the appropriate connections to other mental items in order to count as knowledge. Upon answering each of these objections, Tillson concludes that the notion of knowledge insertion as coherently conceivable can survive extended critical reflection.","[Tillson, John] Liverpool Hope Univ, Dept Educ Studies, Philosophy Educ, Fac Educ, Taggart Ave, Liverpool L16 9JD, Merseyside, England",Liverpool Hope University,"Tillson, J (corresponding author), Liverpool Hope Univ, Dept Educ Studies, Philosophy Educ, Fac Educ, Taggart Ave, Liverpool L16 9JD, Merseyside, England.",tillsoj@hope.ac.uk,,,,,,,15,3,3,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-2004,1741-5446,,EDUC THEORY,Educ.

Holland (1923-2013) exposes the inadequacies of a philosophy of education originating from an empiricist worldview. By following Plato's view that the issue of what qualifies as knowledge has to be understood with reference to whether it is teachable, Holland's critique of empiricism highlights the social and communal dimensions of education. The primary objective of this paper is to offer a reassessment of Holland's thoughts on education and value. To do so, I first discuss Holland's use of Plato's ideas in his article 'Epistemology and Education' to demonstrate that Holland's position can offer us a fruitful way to diagnose common, prevalent educational practices. I then turn to look at Holland's views on value and morality. To illustrate how his thoughts on education can be seen to be relevant to the contemporary world, I explore and criticize some implicit presuppositions on knowledge in the 2011 box-office hit Limitless. The conceptual dimension of Holland's take on education is then examined alongside with some recent trends in epistemology and philosophy of education.","[Yan, Hektor K.

This paper focuses on anti-realism about normativity to investigate this alleged advantage to anti-realism in detail. I set up a framework in which a version of anti-realism explains a type of modal reliability that appears to be epistemologically promising, and plausibly explains the appearance of an epistemological advantage to realism. But, I argue, this appearance is illusory, and on closer investigation the anti-realist view does not succeed in explaining the presence of familiar epistemological properties for normative belief like knowledge or the absence of defeat. My conclusion on the basis of this framework is that there is a tension in the anti-realist view between the urge to idealize the conditions in which normative beliefs ground normative facts, and a robust kind of reliability that normative belief can have if the anti-realist resists these idealizations.","[Dunaway, Billy] Univ Missouri, St Louis, MO 63121 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Saint Louis,"Dunaway, B (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, St Louis, MO 63121 USA.",dunawayw@umsl.edu,,,,,,,31,3,3,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0031-8116,1573-0883,,PHILOS STUD,Philos.

Still, they would agreein a seemingly Cartesian spiritthat if infallible knowledge was available then it would be a stronger link to truth than fallible knowledge ever manages to be. But this paper argues that infallible knowledge lacks that supposed advantage over fallible knowledge.

J,"Horvath, J",,,,"Horvath, Joachim",,,Philosophical Analysis: The Concept Grounding View,PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH,,,English,Article,,,,,,,DEFINITIONS; OBJECTS,"Philosophical analysis was the central preoccupation of 20th-century analytic philosophy. In the contemporary methodological debate, however, it faces a number of pressing external and internal challenges. While external challenges, like those from experimental philosophy or semantic externalism, have been extensively discussed, internal challenges to philosophical analysis have received much less attention. One especially vexing internal challenge is that the success conditions of philosophical analysis are deeply unclear. According to the standard textbook view, a philosophical analysis aims at a strict biconditional that captures the necessary and sufficient conditions for membership in the relevant category. The textbook view arguably identifies a necessary condition on successful philosophical analyses, but understood as a sufficient condition it is untenable, as I will argue in this paper. To this end, I first uncover eight conditions of adequacy on successful philosophical analyses, some of which have rarely been spelled out in detail. As we shall see, even sophisticated alternatives to the textbook view fail to accommodate some of these conditions. I then propose the concept grounding view as a more promising account of philosophical analysis. According to this view, successful philosophical analyses require necessary biconditionals that are constrained by grounding relations among the concepts involved. Apart from providing a satisfactory account of philosophical analysis in its own right, the concept grounding view is also able to meet the challenge that the success conditions of philosophical analysis are problematically unclear.","[Horvath, Joachim] Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Horvath, J (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany.",,,"Horvath, Joachim/0000-0003-2713-5135",,,,,105,10,10,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0031-8205,1933-1592,,PHILOS PHENOMEN RES,Philos.

Friendship, it is argued, is a relationship between two people in which each participant values the other and successfully communicates this fact to the other. This feature of friendship, it is claimed, explains why friendship plays a key role in human happiness, why it is praised by philosophers, poets, and novelists, and why we all seek friends. Although the characterization of friendship proposed here differs from other views in the literature, it is shown that it accommodates key insights of other writers on the topic. Thus, in accordance with the Aristotelian strategy the paper employs, it is shown that the account on offer preserves the received opinions on friendship.","[Leibowitz, Uri D.] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel",Ben Gurion University,"Leibowitz, UD (corresponding author), Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel.",urileib@bgu.ac.il,"Leibowitz, Uri/GPF-7904-2022; Leibowitz, Uri/AAK-8597-2021; Leibowitz, Uri/GPX-5061-2022","Leibowitz, Uri/0000-0001-8008-6059",,,,,23,6,7,2,40,SCIENDO,WARSAW,"DE GRUYTER POLAND SP Z O O, BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR, 01-811 WARSAW, POLAND",0873-626X,,,DISPUTATIO,Disputatio,NOV,2018,10,49,,,,,97,117,,10.2478/disp-2018-0008,http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/disp-2018-0008,,,21,Philosophy,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Philosophy,HZ0OE,,gold,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000468539500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Big Bang paradigm and the Lambda CDM 'concordance model' involve such beliefs: the emanation of the universe out of a non-physical stage, cosmic inflation (hardly testable), Lambda (fictitious energy), and 'exotic' dark matter. They fail in the confidence check that empirical science requires. They also face a problem in delimiting what expands from what does not. In the more well-founded cosmology that emerges, energy is conserved, the universe is persistent (not transient), and the 'perfect cosmological principle' holds. Waves and other field perturbations that propagate at c (the escape velocity of the universe) expand exponentially with distance. This results from gravitation. The galaxy web does not expand. Potential Phi varies as -H/(cz) instead of -1/r. Inertial forces reflect gradients present in comoving frames of accelerated bodies (interaction with the rest of the universe - not with space). They are increased where the universe appears blue-shifted and decreased more than proportionately at very low accelerations. A cut-off acceleration a(0) = 0.168 cH is deduced. This explains the successful description of galaxy rotation curves by Modified Newtonian Dynamics. A fully elaborated physical theory is still pending. The recycling of energy via a cosmic ocean filled with photons (the cosmic microwave background), neutrinos and gravitons, and the wider implications for science are briefly discussed.","[Traunmuller, Hartmut] Stockholm Univ, Dept Linguist, Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Traunmüller, H (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Linguist, Stockholm, Sweden.",hartmut@ling.su.se,,"Traunmuller, Hartmut/0000-0003-4065-7309",,,,,98,2,2,0,2,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0932-0784,1865-7109,,Z NATURFORSCH A,Z.

Borsboom et al.

Hood (Erkenntnis, 78(4):739-761 2013) deemphasized Borsboom et al.'s position and argued that the choice of a reflective measurement model does not necessarily require ontological commitments, though, in his view, it does necessitate a commitment to minimal epistemic realism. Although these arguments are formulated with regard to psychological research, they can actually be generalized to other disciplines in social sciences that use similar methodologies and statistical techniques. In Hood's opinion, empiricism does not suffice to provide an adequate account of the choice of reflective measurement models given that this choice requires an appeal to causal explanations. In this paper, we argue against Hood and answer this challenge, providing epistemic foundations for social science research that do not appeal to realism.","[Peterson, Clayton] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Munich Ctr Math Philosophy, Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Peterson, C (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Munich Ctr Math Philosophy, Munich, Germany.",clayton.peterson@outlook.com,"Peterson, Clayton/AAZ-5781-2021","Peterson, Clayton/0000-0003-0592-2197",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"I am indebted to anonymous referees for comments and suggestions made on previous drafts of this paper.

But there are many internalism/externalism debates in epistemology, and it is not always clear how these debates relate to each other. In the present paper I investigate the relation between epistemic luck and prominent internalist and externalist accounts of epistemic justification. I argue that the dichotomy between internalist and externalist concepts of justification can be characterized in terms of epistemic luck. Whereas externalist theories of justification are incompatible with veritic luck but not with reflective luck, the converse is true for internalist theories of justification. These results are found to explain and cohere with some recent findings from elsewhere in epistemology, and support a surprising picture of justification, on which internalism and externalism are complementary rather than contradictory positions.","[de Grefte, Job] Univ Groningen, Fac Philosophy, Oude Boteringestr 52, NL-9712 GL Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"de Grefte, J (corresponding author), Univ Groningen, Fac Philosophy, Oude Boteringestr 52, NL-9712 GL Groningen, Netherlands.",j.a.m.de.grefte@rug.nl,,"de Grefte, Job/0000-0003-2433-952X",,,,,51,6,6,0,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0039-7857,1573-0964,,SYNTHESE,Synthese,SEP,2018,195,9,,,SI,,3821,3836,,10.1007/s11229-016-1306-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11229-016-1306-7,,,16,History & Philosophy Of Science; Philosophy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),History & Philosophy of Science; Philosophy,GT2JJ,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000444317800007,View Full Record in Web of Science

The demonstration of competence, I will argue, can provide individuals with robust spheres of non-interference in which they can pursue their lives in accordance with their own values. This protection from paternalism is achieved by granting individuals rights to non-interference upon demonstration of competence. In this paper, I present a risk-sensitive account of competence as a means of grounding rights to non-interference. On a risk-sensitive account of competence individuals demonstrate their competence by exercising three capacities to the extent necessary to meet a threshold determined by the riskiness of the decision. These three capacities are the capacity to (i) acquire knowledge, (ii) use instrumental rationality, and (iii) form and revise a life plan.","[Roberts, Joseph T.

J,"White, L",,,,"White, Lucie",,,The Need for Authenticity-Based Autonomy in Medical Ethics,HEC FORUM,,,English,Article,,,,,,Authenticity; Autonomy; Competence; Medical ethics; Locke; Anorexia; Depression,TREATMENT DECISIONS; COMPETENCE; ANOREXIA; DEPRESSION; VALUES; CONSENT,"The notion of respect for autonomy dominates bioethical discussion, though what qualifies precisely as autonomous action is notoriously elusive. In recent decades, the notion of autonomy in medical contexts has often been defined in opposition to the notion of autonomy favoured by theoretical philosophers. Where many contemporary theoretical accounts of autonomy place emphasis on a condition of authenticity, the special relation a desire must have to the self, bioethicists often regard such a focus as irrelevant to the concerns of medical ethics, and too stringent for use in practical contexts. I argue, however, that the very condition of authenticity that forms a focus in theoretical philosophy is also essential to autonomy and competence in medical ethics. After tracing the contours of contemporary authenticity-based theories of autonomy, I consider and respond to objections against the incorporation of a notion of authenticity into accounts of autonomy designed for use in medical contexts. By looking at the typical problems that arise when making judgments concerning autonomy or competence in a medical setting, I reveal the need for a condition of authenticityas a means of protecting choices, particularly high-stakes choices, from being restricted or overridden on the basis of intersubjective disagreement. I then turn to the treatment of false and contestable beliefs, arguing that it is only through reference to authenticity that we can make important distinctions in this domain. Finally, I consider a potential problem with my proposed approach; its ability to deal with anorexic and depressive desires.","[White, Lucie] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Philosophie, Moore 21, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover,"White, L (corresponding author), Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Philosophie, Moore 21, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",lucie.white@philos.uni-hannover.de,,"White, Lucie/0000-0001-8292-3789",,,,,34,12,13,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0956-2737,1572-8498,,HEC FORUM,HEC Forum,SEP,2018,30,3,,,SI,,191,209,,10.1007/s10730-017-9335-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10730-017-9335-2,,,19,Ethics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Social Sciences - Other Topics,GS0SI,28801760,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000443216300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, I describe the problem of cognition-the absence of a positive characterization of cognition despite a felt need for one. It is widely recognized that the problem is motivated by decades of controversy among cognitive scientists over foundational questions, such as whether non-neural parts of the body or environment can realize cognitive processes, or whether plants and microbes have cognitive processes. The dominant strategy for addressing the problem of cognition is to seek a dichotomous criterion that vindicates some set of controversial claims. However, I argue that the problem of cognition is also motivated by ongoing conceptual development in cognitive science, and I describe four benefits that a characterization of cognition could confer. Given these benefits, I recommend an alternative criterion of success, ecumenical extensional adequacy, on which the aim is to describe the variation in expert judgments rather than to correct this variation by taking sides in sectarian disputes. I argue that if we had an ecumenical solution to the problem of cognition, we would have achieved much of what we should want from a mark of the cognitive.","[Akagi, Mikio] Texas Christian Univ, John V Roach Honors Coll, TCU Box 297022, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA",Texas Christian University,"Akagi, M (corresponding author), Texas Christian Univ, John V Roach Honors Coll, TCU Box 297022, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA.",m.akagi@tcu.edu,,"Akagi, Mikio/0000-0003-0996-487X",University of Pittsburgh Department of Philosophy; University of Pittsburgh Office of the Provost; Wesley C.

As such they are at the heart of our linguistic and social practices. Recent research has focused extensively on the question whether the speech act of assertion is governed by norms, and if so, under what conditions it is acceptable to make an assertion. Standard theories propose, for instance, that one should only assert that p if one knows that p (the knowledge account), or that one should only assert that p if p is true (the truth account). In a series of four experiments, this question is addressed empirically. Contrary to previous findings, knowledge turns out to be a poor predictor of assertability, and the norm of assertion is not factive either. The studies here presented provide empirical evidence in favour of the view that a speaker is warranted to assert that p only if her belief that p is justified.","[Kneer, Markus] Univ Zurich, Ramistr 66, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Kneer, M (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Ramistr 66, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland.",markus.kneer@uzh.ch,"Kneer, Markus/AFT-0859-2022","Kneer, Markus/0000-0002-4223-0715",,,,,43,27,28,1,6,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0010-0277,1873-7838,,COGNITION,Cognition,AUG,2018,177,,,,,,165,171,,10.1016/j.cognition.2018.03.020,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2018.03.020,,,7,"Psychology, Experimental",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Psychology,GJ1XS,29684696,Green Published,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000435061800017,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, as Descartes famously pointed out in the Second Meditation, not all knowledge is imperiled by this kind of deception. You still know you are a thinking thing. Perhaps, though, there is a more virulent demon in epistemic hell, one from which none of our knowledge is safe. Jonathan Schaffer (2010) thinks so. The debasing demon he imagines threatens knowledge not via the truth condition on knowledge, but via the basing condition. This demon can cause any belief to seem like it's held on a good basis, when it's really held on a bad basis. Several recent critics grant Schaffer the possibility of such a debasing demon, and argue that the skeptical conclusion doesn't follow. By contrast, we argue that on any plausible account of the epistemic basing relation, the debasing demon is impossible. Our argument for why this is so gestures, more generally, to the importance of avoiding common traps by embracing mistaken assumptions about what it takes for a belief to be based on a reason.","[Bondy, Patrick] St Marys Univ, Halifax, NS, Canada; [Carter, J.

Compositionally, as having constituents like belief and justification, or as an atomic concept? In making arguments for or against these perspectives, epistemologists have begun to use experimental evidence from developmental psychology and developmental linguistics. If we were to conclude that knowledge were developmentally prior to belief, then we might have a good basis to claim that belief is not a constituent of knowledge. In this review, I present a broad range of developmental evidence from the past decade and discuss some of the implications it has for the proper analysis of knowledge. The orthodox perspective from the developmental literature was one where children fail to understand belief and knowledge concepts until later in childhood (around 4-5years of age), with typical asymmetries in belief attribution and knowledge attribution. But what emerges from both a discussion of newer findings and a contextualization of older findings is a picture of development whereby core competence with belief and knowledge concepts emerges much earlier than previously thought (in the first or second year of life) that apparent failures in later childhood may be explained by other aspects of development than conceptual development and that there is no clear evidence that knowledge attributions emerge earlier than belief attributions.","[Dudley, Rachel] Univ Maryland, Dept Linguist, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Dudley, R (corresponding author), 1401 Marie Mt Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",redudley@terpmail.umd.edu,,"Dudley, Rachel/0000-0003-0285-3157","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci [1628110] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,251,10,12,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1747-9991,,,PHILOS COMPASS,Philos.

One challenge to the justified true belief model arises from the proposition of situations in which a person possesses a belief that is both justified and true which some philosophers intuit should not be classified as knowledge. Though situations of this type have been imagined by a number of writers, they have come to be labelled Gettier cases. Gettier cases arise when a fallible justification happens to lead to a true belief in one context, a case of 'lucky belief'. In this article, it is argued that students studying science may make claims that resemble Gettier cases. In some contexts, a student may make a claim that is both justified and true but which arises from an alternative conception of a scientific concept. A number of instances of lucky belief in topics in science education are considered leading to an examination of the criteria teachers use to assess students' claims in different contexts. The possibility of lucky belief leads to the proposal that, in addition to the acquisition of justified true beliefs, the development of reliable belief-forming processes is a significant goal of science education. The pedagogic value of various kinds of claims is considered and, it is argued, the criteria used to judge claims may be adjusted to suit the context of assessment. It is suggested that teachers should be alert to instances of lucky belief that mask alternative conceptions.","[Brock, Richard] Kings Coll London, Sch Educ Commun & Soc, Waterloo Bridge Wing,Franklin Wilkins Bldg, London SE1 9NH, England",University of London; King's College London,"Brock, R (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, Sch Educ Commun & Soc, Waterloo Bridge Wing,Franklin Wilkins Bldg, London SE1 9NH, England.",richard.brock@kcl.ac.uk,,"Brock, Richard/0000-0003-2497-8030",,,,,78,2,2,0,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0926-7220,1573-1901,,SCI EDUC-NETHERLANDS,Sci.

For over a decade and a half, some experimental epistemologists have called into question this appeal to epistemic intuitions. These philosophers bring the methods of experimental psychology, in particular survey methods, to bear on epistemological theorizing. Given their commitment to the relevance of empirical work to philosophical theory construction, they qualify as methodological naturalists. But some methodological naturalists who also recommend giving up appeals to intuition as evidence do not base their case on experimental surveys. In this article I consider two main challenges to the standard practice of appealing to intuitions posed by these naturalist philosophers and argue that a Craig-style epistemological project can allow the methodological naturalist to address them.

However, what could be so fuzzy about the concept of knowledge that it makes our intuitions to not obviously support a single analysis? One particular approach from a naturalistic perspective treats this question from the point of view of the psychology of concepts. According to it, this failure is explained by the structure of our folk concept of knowledge, which organizes its constitutive information in a much looser way than we assume when we rely on intuitive knowledge ascriptions. I will adopt the same starting point here, but argue against the proposed answer and defend the view that this difficulty is explained not by something related to the specific structure of our concept of knowledge but, on the contrary, by its lack of structure.

He seems to suggest that by attaching to a true opinion a 'calculation of cause' or some sort of account, we can convert it into knowledge. Many scholars and epistemologists have taken this suggestion as evidence that the traditional definition of knowledge as justified true belief traces back to Plato. In this paper, I claim that it is inaccurate to suppose that Plato foresaw the tripartite analysis of knowledge of the Contemporary Epistemology. Focusing on the theory of recollection and the distinction between true opinion and knowledge in the Meno, I intent to show that the two-world metaphysics implies the treatment of opinion and knowledge as cognitions which are essentially different and mutually irreducible. Also, since Socrates was mainly concerned with the notion of knowledge as knowing what (is) which requires an apprehension of essences or Forms, he did not pay particular attention to the knowing that. As a result, Socrates did not argue to establish the conditions of justification to be given propositionally in order for a belief becomes knowledge.","[Pereira da Silva, Jose Lourenco] Univ Fed Santa Maria, Santa Maria, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM),"da Silva, JLP (corresponding author), Univ Fed Santa Maria, Santa Maria, RS, Brazil.",jlourenco38@gmail.com,,,,,,,60,0,0,0,11,UNIV BRASILIA,BRASILIA,"CAIXA POSTAL 4497, BRASILIA, DF 70904-970, BRAZIL",1984-249X,,,ARCHAI,Archai,MAY-AUG,2018,23,,,,,,167,204,,10.14195/1984-249X_23_6,http://dx.doi.org/10.14195/1984-249X_23_6,,,38,"Humanities, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Arts & Humanities - Other Topics,GG5FS,,gold,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000432721500007,View Full Record in Web of Science

The first is a defense and the rest is a critical appraisal of a crucial notion involved in the defense. First, it argues that John Turri's criticisms of Ernest Sosa's virtue epistemological account of knowledge that it fails to rule out Gettier cases rest on a misconstrual of the because of clause which Sosa employs. Turri overlooks the notion of success manifests competence which is central to understand the because of clause. Thus, the position of Sosa is defended from the criticisms of Turri. Secondly, it critically examines the notion of success manifests competence which is a crucial notion in Sosa's account. It argues, unlike what Sosa seems to hold, some of the conditions which Sosa provides for success manifests competence are not necessary. It also clarifies, by agreeing with Sosa, that the conditions he provides are not sufficient for success manifests competence. Thirdly, it briefly argues that Sosa's occasional insistence that complete competence should be present in the case of success manifests competence brings in certain internal tension in the account of Sosa. Thus, the paper defends Sosa's position from the criticisms of Turri; but it also clarifies Sosa's account as well as raises some criticisms to it.","[Sreejith, K.

This paper explains how it can be met. Thus, it is argued that the thought experiment contains a hidden ambiguity concerning the visual ability typically ascribed to, or denied, fake barn subjects. Disambiguation shows fake barn subjects to have limited knowledge of the target proposition (e.g. that there is a barn ahead). This accords with a pure virtue-theoretic conception of knowledge that predicts and explains all the intuitions elicited by the thought experiment. As a result, the relationship between knowledge, luck and ability is illuminated, and our epistemological theorizing improved.","[Garcia Rodriguez, Angel] Univ Murcia, Dept Filosofia, Murcia, Spain",University of Murcia,"Rodríguez, AG (corresponding author), Univ Murcia, Dept Filosofia, Murcia, Spain.",agarcia@um.es,,,Spanish government [FFI2012-38908-C02-02],Spanish government(Spanish Government),"Work for this paper was supported by a grant from the Spanish government (ref.

It includes requirements for engagement with stakeholders (including the public) regarding actions proposed by a proponent. A key issue with the various stakeholders involved is the perceived legitimacy of the IA, which can have implications both for the reputation of the proponent, and the likelihood of conflict over the decision. But the understanding of legitimacy in the IA literature has changed over time in line with an ontological shift from positivism (that scientifically generated information leads to better informed decisions) to the post-positivist acknowledgement of the limitations of scientific method whereby assumptions must be subject to transparency, deliberation and openness. This has led to an epistemological shift towards greater subjectivism which, we suggest, has created new opportunities (which have been realised in political decision-making) to subvert knowledge through the increased use of the Internet and social media. To address the potential for such subversion of legitimacy, we seek to conceptualise legitimacy in the IA context through framing IA around a critical realist ontology and a reliabilist virtue epistemology. This allows us to identify 'knowledge legitimacy' as an equally important component of IA legitimacy along with organisational legitimacy. We conceptualise knowledge legitimacy through literature review drawing on rich understandings of knowledge from IA and other fields of research in order to develop a four-dimensional typology. This includes the dimensions of: knowledge accuracy; knowledge restriction; knowledge diffusion; and knowledge spectrum. This is the first theoretically grounded attempt to understand legitimacy in IA. It is hoped that it will provoke discussion in the IA community to further advance theoretical understandings of IA and legitimacy of practice.","[Bond, Alan] Univ East Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Pope, Jenny] Integral Sustainabil, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Bond, Alan; Pope, Jenny; Retief, Francois; Morrison-Saunders, Angus] North West Univ, Res Unit Environm Sci & Management, Potchefstroom, South Africa; [Pope, Jenny; Morrison-Saunders, Angus] Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Sci, Environm Management, Churchlands, WA, Australia",University of East Anglia; North West University - South Africa; Edith Cowan University,"Bond, A (corresponding author), Univ East Anglia, Sch Environm Sci, Norwich, Norfolk, England.",alan.bond@uea.ac.uk,"Retief, Francois/ABF-1820-2020; Morrison-Saunders, Angus/AAG-4178-2019","Pope, Jenny/0000-0002-0099-854X",,,,,82,23,25,2,21,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0195-9255,1873-6432,,ENVIRON IMPACT ASSES,Environ.

First, the basic components of this concept suffer from multiple ambiguities, which hamper attempts to ground informative evaluative and classificatory judgments about the worth of life. Second, the criteria proposed to track the extension of the concept of life worth living rest on unsupported axiological assumptions and fail to identify precise and plausible referents for this concept. And third, the concept of life worth living is not shown to serve any major evaluative or classificatory purpose besides those served by already available axiological concepts. By eliminating the concept of life worth living, philosophers will free themselves of the task of addressing ill-posed axiological questions and ground reflection about the worth of life on more rigorous conceptual foundations.","[Fumagalli, Roberto] Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth, Germany; [Fumagalli, Roberto] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Fumagalli, Roberto] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Bayreuth; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Pennsylvania,"Fumagalli, R (corresponding author), Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth, Germany.;Fumagalli, R (corresponding author), London Sch Econ, London, England.;Fumagalli, R (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",R.Fumagalli@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,112,12,13,2,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0031-8116,1573-0883,,PHILOS STUD,Philos.

Drawing on discussions of sensitivity and safety in epistemology, the article explores how similar considerations apply to legal proof. In the legal context, sensitivity concerns whether a factual finding would be made if it were false, and safety concerns how easily a factual finding could be false. The article critiques recent claims about the importance of sensitivity for the law of evidence. In particular, this critique argues that sensitivity does not have much of an effect on the value of legal evidence and that it fails to explain legal doctrine. By contrast, safety affects the quality of legal evidence, and safety better explains central features of the law of evidence, including probative value, admissibility rules, and standards of proof.","[Pardo, Michael S.] Univ Alabama, Sch Law, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Pardo, MS (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, Sch Law, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",,,,Alabama Law School Foundation,Alabama Law School Foundation,"My thanks for helpful comments on previous drafts to Ron Allen, Mark Brandon, Scott Hershovitz, David Manley, Sarah Moss, Dennis Patterson, Meredith Render, Alex Stein, the participants at a seminar at the University of Michigan Philosophy Department, and the anonymous referees for this journal.

Questions about the etiology of understanding have also been at the heart of recent theoretical debates within epistemology. Kvanvig (2003) put forward the argument that there could be lucky understanding and produced an example that he deemed persuasive. Grimm (2006) responded with a case that, he argued, demonstrated that there could not be lucky understanding. In this paper, we empirically examine how participants' patterns of understanding attributions line up with the predictions of Kvanvig and Grimm. We argue that the data challenge Kvanvig's position. People do not differentiate between knowing-why and understanding-why on the basis of proper etiology: attributions of knowledge and understanding involve comparable (and minimal) roles for epistemic luck. We thus posit that folk knowledge and understanding are etiologically symmetrical.","[Wilkenfeld, Daniel A.] Univ Pittsburgh, Hist & Philosophy Sci Dept, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Plunkett, Dillon] Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, 33 Kirkland St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Lombrozo, Tania] Univ Calif Berkeley, Psychol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Harvard University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Wilkenfeld, DA (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Hist & Philosophy Sci Dept, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",dawilk@gmail.com,,"Lombrozo, Tania/0000-0001-5637-1431",,,,,30,4,4,0,0,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1742-3600,1750-0117,,EPISTEME-J INDIV SOC,Episteme,MAR,2018,15,1,,,,,24,49,,10.1017/epi.2016.38,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/epi.2016.38,,,26,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,GB4VD,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000429058900002,View Full Record in Web of Science

We review research on the implications of hypocognition for cognition and behavior. Drawing on the expertise and cross-cultural literatures, we describe how hypocognition impoverishes one's mental world, leaving cognitive deficits in recognition, explanation, and memory while fueling social chauvinism and conflict in political and cultural spheres. Despite its pervasive consequences, people cannot be expected to identify when they are in a hypocognitive state, mistaking what they conceive for the totality of all that there is.

Ethical concerns have been voiced about a possible raise in the number of wrongs and crimes in military operations and about the creation of a responsibility gap for harms caused by these systems. To address these concerns, the principle of meaningful human control has been introduced in the legal-political debate; according to this principle, humans not computers and their algorithms should ultimately remain in control of, and thus morally responsible for, relevant decisions about (lethal) military operations. However, policy-makers and technical designers lack a detailed theory of what meaningful human control exactly means. In this paper, we lay the foundation of a philosophical account of meaningful human control, based on the concept of guidance control as elaborated in the philosophical debate on free will and moral responsibility. Following the ideals of Responsible Innovation and Value-sensitive Design, our account of meaningful human control is cast in the form of design requirements. We identify two general necessary conditions to be satisfied for an autonomous system to remain under meaningful human control: first, a tracking condition, according to which the system should be able to respond to both the relevant moral reasons of the humans designing and deploying the system and the relevant facts in the environment in which the system operates; second, a tracing condition, according to which the system should be designed in such a way as to grant the possibility to always trace back the outcome of its operations to at least one human along the chain of design and operation. As we think that meaningful human control can be one of the central notions in ethics of robotics and AI, in the last part of the paper, we start exploring the implications of our account for the design and use of non-military autonomous systems, for instance, self-driving cars.","[de Sio, Filippo Santoni; van den Hoven, Jeroen] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Sect Eth Philosophy Technol, Delft, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology,"de Sio, FS (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Sect Eth Philosophy Technol, Delft, Netherlands.",f.santonidesio@tudelft.nl,,,,,,,82,142,146,5,50,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-9144,,,FRONT ROBOT AI,Front.

Modest virtue epistemologists agree with robust virtue epistemologists that if someone knows, then her cognitive success must be because of her intellectual virtues, but they think that more is needed for knowledge. More specifically, they introduce independently motivated modal anti-luck principles in their accounts to amend the problem of eliminating luck-this makes their views instances of impure virtue epistemology. The aim of the paper is to argue, firstly, that such a move lacks adequate motivation; secondly, that the resulting impure accounts equally fail to handle knowledge-undermining luck. On a more positive note, these results bolster a more orthodox virtue-theoretic approach to knowledge that assigns a fundamental explanatory role to the notion of ability. In this sense, the paper also sketches an account of ability and a corresponding account of knowledge that explains how success from ability (of the right kind) is incompatible with success from luck.","[Broncano-Berrocal, Fernando] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Media Cognit & Commun, KUA2,Bldg 16-1-20, DK-2300 Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Broncano-Berrocal, F (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Dept Media Cognit & Commun, KUA2,Bldg 16-1-20, DK-2300 Copenhagen, Denmark.",f.broncano.berrocal@hum.ku.dk,"Broncano-Berrocal, Fernando/AAH-2011-2019","Broncano-Berrocal, Fernando/0000-0001-6472-2684",H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions (Individual Fellowship),H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions (Individual Fellowship),"I would like to thank Chris Kelp, Klemens Kappel, Giacomo Melis, Josefine Pallavicini, Bjorn Hallsson and Frederik J.

Thought experiments come with variegated theoretical commitments. These commitments are risky. They may turn out to be false or at least controversial. Other things being equal, it seems preferable to do with minimal commitments. I explore exemplary ways of minimising commitments, focusing on modal ones. There is a near-consensus to treat the scenarios considered in thought experiments as metaphysical possibilities (most aptly treated as possible worlds). I challenge this consensus. Paradigmatic thought experiments do not have to come with a commitment to metaphysical possibilities. In the first section, I point out difficulties with the prevailing focus on metaphysical possibilities. In the second section, I present alternative formalisations of a paradigmatic thought experiment, the Gettier experiment. Gettier's words leave open the kind of possibilities under consideration. The standard way of spelling out Gettier's argument uses metaphysical possibilities. One alternative proposal uses nomological possibilities. A second one uses epistemic possibilities. My modest conclusion: as long as it is not established that a thought experiment requires a commitment to metaphysical modality, one should avoid such a commitment. My preferred way of doing so is to replace the commitment to one particular formalisation by a commitment to a disjunction of alternative formalisations.","[Dohrn, Daniel] HU Berlin, Inst Philosophie, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,"Dohrn, D (corresponding author), HU Berlin, Inst Philosophie, Unter Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany.",Daniel_Dohrn@yahoo.com,,"Dohrn, Daniel/0000-0002-0148-3070",,,,,42,2,2,1,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0031-8116,1573-0883,,PHILOS STUD,Philos.

Some scholars disagree with the attribution of JTB to Plato. I analyze three influential arguments against the assumption of Plato's agreement with JTB, and refute them. Then I provide my own argument against the assumption. I argue that the contemporary interpretation of the JTB formula understands belief' not in the sense of an opinion, but rather of a degree of confidence. Accordingly, justification is understood not as applying to the opinion itself, but rather to the person having a certain degree of confidence. I support this claim by showing the difference between the traditional and the contemporary understanding of evidence, the former referring to a property of the proposition, while the latter meaning the body of reasons, which supports the person's confidence to a certain degree. Thus, I conclude that Plato understands knowledge as correct opinion validated by a rational explanation, and it has very little in common with the contemporary understanding of knowledge as sufficiently supported subjective degree of confidence in the truth of a proposition.","[Butakov, Pavel] RAS, SB, Inst Philosophy & Law, Novosibirsk, Russia","Institute of Philosophy & Law, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences; Russian Academy of Sciences","Butakov, P (corresponding author), RAS, SB, Inst Philosophy & Law, Novosibirsk, Russia.",pavelbutakov@academ.org,"Butakov, Pavel/J-3410-2018","Butakov, Pavel/0000-0001-8133-1626",,,,,22,0,1,1,4,NOVOSIBIRSK STATE UNIV,NOVOSIBIRSK,"UL PIROGOVA, DOM 2, NOVOSIBIRSK, 630090, RUSSIA",1995-4328,1995-4336,,SCHOLE-RUSS,Schole,,2018,12,2,,,,,669,685,,10.21267/schole.12.2.23,http://dx.doi.org/10.21267/schole.12.2.23,,,17,Philosophy,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Philosophy,GJ6UO,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000435520100023,View Full Record in Web of Science

The above questions are particularly pressing given recent methodological disputes in philosophy. The so-called expertise defense recently proposed as a reply to experimental philosophers postulates that philosophers are experts qua having improved intuitions. However, this model of philosophical expertise has been challenged by studies suggesting that philosophers' intuitions are no less prone to biases and distortions than intuitions of non-philosophers. Should we then give up on the idea that philosophers possess some sort of expertise? In this paper, I argue that instead of focusing on intuitions, we may understand the relevant results of philosophical practice more broadly and investigate the other kind(s) of expertise they would require. My proposal is inspired by a prominent approach to investigating expert performance from psychology and suggests where and how to look for expertise in the results characteristic of philosophical practice. In developing this model, I discuss the following three candidates for such results: arguments, theories, and distinctions. Whether philosophers could be shown to be expert intuiters or not, there are interesting domains where we could look for philosophical expertise, beyond intuitions.","[Drozdzowicz, Anna] Aarhus Univ, Ctr Sci Studies, Aarhus, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Drozdzowicz, A (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Ctr Sci Studies, Aarhus, Denmark.",anna.drozdzowicz@gmail.com,,,Sapere Aude Project Intuitions in Science and Philosophy - Danish Council for Independent Research [DFF 4180-00071],Sapere Aude Project Intuitions in Science and Philosophy - Danish Council for Independent Research,This work was supported by and developed as part of the Sapere Aude Project Intuitions in Science and Philosophy funded by Danish Council for Independent Research [grant number DFF 4180-00071].,,86,13,13,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0951-5089,1465-394X,,PHILOS PSYCHOL,Philos.

This new paradigm has an abductive methodology and a thesis on the explanatory priority of knowing in its core. From this it derives several knowledge norms as, e.g., the knowledge norm of action, which states that one should only act on what is known. While this norm gets things right with respect to epistemic standards and epistemic blamability, it runs counter to the traditional justification of the laws of belief and rationality of actions. This paper gives a historical and systematical overview of the belief first and knowledge first paradigms. The central claims regarding action are explicated and an exact formulation of the knowledge norm of action is provided and justified. This norm avoids the mentioned problems while at the same time maintaining the advantages of putting forward high epistemic standards.","[Feldbacher-Escamilla, Christian J.] Univ Duesseldorf, DCLPS, Univ Str 1, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany",,"Feldbacher-Escamilla, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Duesseldorf, DCLPS, Univ Str 1, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.",cj.feldbacher.escamilla@gmail.com,"Feldbacher-Escamilla, Christian J./R-8455-2019","Feldbacher-Escamilla, Christian J./0000-0001-6414-2153",German Research Foundation (DFG) [FOR 2495],German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"For valuable discussions on this topic I would like to thank Alexander Gebharter, Christoph Jager, Mariana E.

When the judgements and the theses conflict, it is often the latter that are rejected. But what is the nature of the judgements such that they are able to play this role? I answer this question by arguing that typical judgements about thought experiments are in fact judgements of normal counterfactual sufficiency. I begin by focusing on Anna-Sara Malmgren's defence of the claim that typical judgements about thought experiments are mere possibility judgements. This view is shown to fail for two closely related reasons: it cannot account for the incorrectness of certain misjudgements, and it cannot account for the inconsistency of certain pairs of conflicting judgements. This prompts a reconsideration of Timothy Williamson's alternative proposal, according to which typical judgements about thought experiments are counterfactual in nature. I show that taking such judgements to concern what would normally hold in instances of the relevant hypothetical scenarios avoids the objections that have been pressed against this kind of view. I then consider some other potential objections, but argue that they provide no grounds for doubt.","[Geddes, Alexander] Univ Southampton, Southampton, Hants, England",University of Southampton,"Geddes, A (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Southampton, Hants, England.",a.geddes@soton.ac.uk,,,,,,,35,8,8,0,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0026-4423,1460-2113,,MIND,Mind,JAN,2018,127,505,,,,,35,67,,10.1093/mind/fzx005,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mind/fzx005,,,33,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,GA1WO,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-07-12,WOS:000428108500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The first one, the simple reliabilism developed by Alvin Goldman, has as its central goal to offer an adequate characterization of the justificational element present in the standard account of knowledge. Goldman's proposal has the initial challenge of explaining properly Gettier's demand presented some years earlier, but also to correct some more central problems that affect Goldnnan's causal theory of knowledge. However, the externalist proposal within Goldman's simple reliabilism faced some serious attacks directed to its notion of justification. Three of these attacks became more known in the recent literature: the generality problem, the meta-incoherence problem and the new evil genius problem. Each one in its own way has established challenges to the simple reliabilist account. The second reliabilist theory we will discuss consists in a reformulation of Goldman's account, under the name of virtue realibilism - or virtue perspectivism, developed and defended mainly by Ernest Sosa, in a series of very important works in contemporary epistemology. In these works, Sosa was able to insert the notion of intellectual virtues in the epistemological debate, bringing to the center of the externalist debate an idea of a responsible belief formation, and at the same time he tried to give a proper answer to the more central challenges faced by original reliabilism. In the first part of the paper we will present the first of these theories, and after that we will offer a treatment of Sosa's reformulation of reliabilism and a defense of this proposal as a more adequate theory to deal with some basic demands made of a proper theory of justification.","[Guimaraes Santos, Breno Ricardo] Univ Fed Mato Grosso, Filosofia, Cuiaba, MT, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso,"Santos, BRG (corresponding author), Univ Fed Mato Grosso, Filosofia, Cuiaba, MT, Brazil.",breno.ricardo@gmail.com,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,2,"UNIV FEDERAL PIAUI, EDITORA",PIAUI,"CAMPUS PROFA, CINOBELINA ELVAS, BOM JESUS, PIAUI, 64900-000, BRAZIL",2178-843X,,,PENSANDO,Pensando,,2018,9,18,,,,,265,298,,,,,,34,Philosophy,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Philosophy,HM1ET,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000459192900017,View Full Record in Web of Science

Conceptual analysis as ordinarily understood in analytic philosophy is a method which consists in drawing a conclusion about what the definition of a predicate is on the basis of an armchair investigation into whether the predicate is semantically applicable in different possible cases; but, the concept of conceptual analysis can be improved by making two changes to it: 1) the investigation into whether the predicate is semantically applicable in different possible cases is not to serve as a basis for a conclusion about what the definition of the predicate is, but as a basis for a conclusion about whether this-and-this is an only necessary, only sufficient, both necessary and sufficient, or neither necessary nor sufficient condition for the predicate's semantic application; 2) the investigation into whether the predicate is semantically applicable in different possible cases is done not only from the armchair, but also empirically.","[Valchev, Hristo Ivanov] Sofia Univ St Kliment Ohridski, Sofia, Bulgaria",University of Sofia,"Valchev, HI (corresponding author), Sofia Univ St Kliment Ohridski, Sofia, Bulgaria.",hristo_ivanov_valchev@abv.bg,,"Valchev, Hristo/0000-0002-1170-7621",,,,,30,1,1,0,7,ACAD PUBL HOUSE,SOFIA,"1113 ACAD G BONCHEV ST, SOFIA, 6, BULGARIA",1313-888X,2367-5438,,BALK J PHILOS,Balk.

This article, by contrast, intends to provide a new interpretation of iki in the light of Kuki's theory of contingency. The specific thesis of this paper is that aesthetic phenomena categorized as subject to the principles of iki are positively evaluated in Japanese culture just because the consciousness of iki is just one form of the consciousness of contingency, in which the awareness of alternatives to the actual situation could produce considerable spiritual entertainment for aesthetic subjects.","[Xu, Yingjin] Sudan Univ, Sch Philosophy, Shanghai, Peoples R China",,"Xu, YJ (corresponding author), Sudan Univ, Sch Philosophy, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",yjxu@fudan.edu,,,,,,,21,0,0,2,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0955-2367,1469-2961,,ASIAN PHILOS,Asian Philos.,,2018,28,3,,,,,277,294,,10.1080/09552367.2018.1507242,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09552367.2018.1507242,,,18,Asian Studies; Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Asian Studies; Philosophy,GT8TT,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000444813400006,View Full Record in Web of Science

The first is that, while such arguments are often motivated with the rhetoric of luck', proponents of these arguments have not distinguished between the kinds of luck that might lead to the formation of a true belief. Once we make the needed distinctions, the relevance of the kind of luck which can be derived from broadly evolutionary explanations to the epistemological conclusions debunkers draw is suspect. The second thesis is that debunkers might successfully show that epistemic luck is relevant to their concerns. But they will need to include specific premises about the kind of evolutionary mechanism that explains the beliefs that the debunker targets. Proponents of debunking arguments, if they continue to insist on using luck-based considerations, are then hostage to empirical fortune in a way not previously recognized.","[Dunaway, Billy] Univ Missouri, Philosophy, St Louis, MO 63121 USA; [Dunaway, Billy] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Saint Louis; University of Oxford,"Dunaway, B (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Philosophy, St Louis, MO 63121 USA.",dunawayw@umsl.edu,,,,,,,28,3,4,0,0,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1742-3600,1750-0117,,EPISTEME-J INDIV SOC,Episteme,DEC,2017,14,4,,,,,441,461,,10.1017/epi.2016.13,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/epi.2016.13,,,21,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,FN4WD,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000416006500004,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, I evaluate an answer to this question offered by virtue epistemology and show that the latest analyses imply that virtue epistemology cannot explain the special value of knowledge-that. The definitions of knowledge proposed by virtue epistemologists either apply only to knowledge-how, or cannot address the value problem. The aim of this paper is to show how virtue epistemology can account for the high epistemic status of knowledge-how of both individual and extended cognitive systems. I argue that, among extended cognitive systems, only those composed of two or more people can be regarded as subjects of knowledge-how. As far as systems that consist of a single person and her cognitive enhancement are concerned, virtue epistemology is a reductive theory of knowledge-how, as it attributes knowledge-how only to that person.","[Trybulec, Barbara] Uniwersytet Marii Curie Sklodowskiej, Inst Filozofii, Pl M Curie Sklodowskiej 4, PL-20031 Lublin, Poland",Maria Curie-Sklodowska University,"Trybulec, B (corresponding author), Uniwersytet Marii Curie Sklodowskiej, Inst Filozofii, Pl M Curie Sklodowskiej 4, PL-20031 Lublin, Poland.",barbara.trybulec@poczta.umcs.lublin.pl,,"Trybulec, Barbara/0000-0001-8145-7755","National Science Centre, Poland [2014/13/D/HS1/00689]","National Science Centre, Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)","This work was realized as a part of the grant Sonata founded by National Science Centre, Poland, 2014/13/D/HS1/00689.",,57,0,0,0,0,"WARSAW UNIV, INST PHILOSOPHY",WARSAW,"UL KRAKOWSKIE PRZEDMIESCIE 3, WARSAW, 00-927, POLAND",1230-6894,,,FILOZ NAUK,Filoz.

Key features of Kant's account of cognitive judgment are widely dispersed amongst various sections of the Critique of Pure Reason, whilst common philosophical proclivities have confounded these interpretive difficulties. This paper characterises Kant's account of causal-perceptual judgment concisely to highlight one central philosophical achievement: Kant's finding that, to understand and investigate empirical knowledge we must distinguish between predication as a grammatical form of sentences, statements or (candidate) judgments, and predication as a (proto) cognitive act of ascribing some characteristic(s) to some localised particular(s). With Kant's finding in view, I then elucidate how we have occluded his achievement. My results are not merely interpretive, but philosophical, because they show that Kant's account of perceptual judgment accords with - and indeed justifies - a central and sound point regarding language, thought and reference advocated by apparently unlikely philosophical comrades.

We discuss the plausible views of Ted Warfield and Branden Fitelson regarding cases of knowledge acquired via inference from false premises, and we show how our sensitivity analysis can account for such cases. We present arguments designed to discredit putative counterexamples to sensitivity analyses recently proffered by Tristan Haze, John Williams and Neil Sinhababu, which involve true statements made by untrustworthy informants and strange clocks that sometimes display the correct time while running backwards.

In this paper I argue that E=K, contrary to what Comesaa and Kantin would want us to believe, is compatible with the agent being justified in believing a falsehood.","[Borges, Rodrigo] Pontificia Univ Catolica Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",Pontificia Universidade Catolica Do Rio Grande Do Sul,"Borges, R (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",epistemen@gmail.com,,"Borges, Rodrigo/0000-0002-0150-6295",CAPES/Fulbright Commission; CAPES/FAPESP,CAPES/Fulbright Commission(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); CAPES/FAPESP(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)),This research has been partially funded by the CAPES/Fulbright Commission and by a CAPES/FAPESP Post-Doctoral Fellowship Grant.,,24,0,0,0,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0106,1572-8420,,ERKENNTNIS,Erkenntnis,OCT,2017,82,5,,,,,1031,1041,,10.1007/s10670-016-9857-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10670-016-9857-z,,,11,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,FL1FF,,Green Published,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000413959300006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Then I will criticize the responses the resulting problem of induction has received by Carnap (1963b, 1968) and Goodman (1954), as well as praise Reichenbach (1938, Journal of Philosophy, 37, 97-103, 1940)'s approach. Some of these authors compare induction to deduction. Haack (Mind, 85, 112-119, 1976) compares deduction to induction, and I will critically discuss her argument for the thesis that we cannot justify the principles of deduction next. In concluding I will defend the thesis that we can justify induction deductively relative to one end, and deduction inductively relative to a different end, and that we can do so in a non-circular way. Along the way I will show how we can understand deductive and inductive logic as normative theories, and I will briefly sketch an argument to the effect that there are only hypothetical, but no categorical imperatives.","[Huber, Franz] Univ Toronto, Inst Hist & Philosophy Sci & Technol, Dept Philosophy, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto,"Huber, F (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Inst Hist & Philosophy Sci & Technol, Dept Philosophy, Toronto, ON, Canada.",franz.huber@utoronto.ca,,,Canadian SSHRC; Connaught Foundation,Canadian SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Connaught Foundation(University of Toronto),My research was supported by the Canadian SSHRC through its Insight program and by the Connaught Foundation through its New Researcher program.,,49,2,2,6,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1879-4912,1879-4920,,EUR J PHILOS SCI,Eur.

The empirical side of our discussion focuses on two novel observations: (i) the interactions between prosody and monotonicity, and (ii) what we call presupposed ignorance. In order to account for these observations, our final proposal relies on two mechanisms of scalar strengthening, the Presupposed Ignorance Principle and an exhaustivity operator which lets the presuppositions of negated alternatives project.","[Spector, Benjamin] PSL Res Univ, Ecole Normale Super, Dept Etud Cognit, Inst Jean Nicod,CNRS,EHESS, Paris, France; [Sudo, Yasutada] UCL, 2 Wakefield St, London E1 1DE, England",Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of London; University College London,"Sudo, Y (corresponding author), UCL, 2 Wakefield St, London E1 1DE, England.",y.sudo@ucl.ac.uk,"Spector, Benjamin/M-9885-2015","Spector, Benjamin/0000-0003-0468-5986","Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-10-LABX-0087 IEC, ANR-10-IDEX-0001-02 PSL]; European Research Council (ERC) [324115-FRONTSEM]; ANR [ANR-14-CE30-0010-01 TriLogMean]",Agence Nationale de la Recherche(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)); ANR(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"Benjamin Spector and Yasutada Sudo acknowledge support from the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (Grants ANR-10-LABX-0087 IEC, ANR-10-IDEX-0001-02 PSL) and the European Research Council (ERC Grant Agreement No. 324115-FRONTSEM, recipient: Philippe Schlenker).

The empirical basis of this picture comes from numerous studies consistently showing that children master verbal false belief (FB) tasks from around age 4 while children much younger have no difficulty in mastering structurally analogous true belief (TB) tasks. The standard picture, though, has come under serious attack from recent studies using TB tasks with wider age ranges. These studies have found that, paradoxically, children begin to fail TB tasks once they master FB tasks. Such findings cast doubt on the standard picture and suggest, instead, that FB tasks may be solved by much simpler strategies than proper belief reasoning. In the present study, we tested for the development of FB and TB performance in comprehensive and systematic ways. In particular, we tested the competing predictions of competence accounts (according to which TB failure reflects lack of conceptual competence) versus performance limitation accounts (according to which the standard picture is true yet children from around age 4 fail TB tasks due to performance factors). Studies 1 and 2 showed that performance in a variety of novel TB tasks showed a clear U-shaped curve, with children until age 3 and from age 10 performing competently and children in between failing, with strong negative correlations between TB and FB. Crucially, these patterns were found for various kinds of TB tasks, including those for which existing competence limitation accounts would not even predict any difficulty. Study 3, therefore, directly tested performance limitation accounts in terms of pragmatic and related factors and found that these patterns (failure in TB and negative TB-FB correlations) disappear once the relevant performance factors have been removed from the TB tasks. Taken together, these findings suggest that previous TB findings constitute false negatives, clearly speak for performance limitation accounts and thus corroborate the standard picture of the development of explicit theory of mind.

This makes one wonder: how did they invent their cases? Were they just lucky to devise a good case, or did they follow some basic rules that are available to all of us? In this paper, we argue for the latter answer by presenting a guidebook for analysing thought experiments. Our guidebook clearly specifies which factors should be included in a thought experiment, and which factors should be left out. This will help students to see through the fantastical elements of TEs, to learn the practice, and to check whether philosophers are doing things right.

In keeping with most mainstream and heterodox discussions of uncertainty in economics, however, Lawson focuses on situations in which the objects of uncertainty are imagined and can be stated in a way that, potentially at least, allows them to be the subject of probability judgments. This focus results in a relative neglect of the kind of uncertainties that flow from the existence of possibilities that do not even enter the imagination and which are therefore ruled out as the subject of probability judgments. This paper explores uncertainties of the latter kind, starting with and building on Donald Rumsfeld's famous observations about known unknowns and unknown unknowns. Various connections are developed, first with Nassim Taleb's Black Swan, and then with Lawson's Keynes-inspired interpretation of uncertainty.","[Faulkner, Phil; Runde, Jochen] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England; [Feduzi, Alberto] Univ London, SOAS, London, England; [Feduzi, Alberto] Univ Technol Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Cambridge; University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); University of Technology Sydney,"Runde, J (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Cambridge Judge Business Sch, Trumpington St, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England.",j.runde@jbs.cam.ac.uk,"Faulkner, Philip B/L-1552-2013","Faulkner, Philip/0000-0002-6074-4533",,,,,58,42,43,1,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

According to the cultural interpretation, exploration and migration are essential features of human culture and society. These are not universal features because there are cultures and societies that have not encouraged exploration and migration. Moreover, the cultures that have explored have seldom conducted exploration for its own sake. According to the biological interpretation there is a psychological or genetic basis for exploration or migration. While there is limited genetic evidence for such a claim, that evidence suggests that genes associated with exploratory behavior were selected for subsequent to migration, making it unlikely that these genes played a role in causing migration. In none of these senses is it clearly true that we have an innate drive to explore or migrate into space; and even if we did it would be fallacious to argue that the existence of such a drive justified spaceflight activities.","[Schwartz, James S.

In this paper, I show what presuppositions about truthmaker theory Fine's objections are based upon, and why they are false. I discuss four objections that Fine raises, and demonstrate how truthmaker theorists may respond to them. I then showcase the positive contribution that truthmaker theory can make to metaphysics, including its ability to speak to a core metaphysical topic (the ontological grounds for truths) that Fine's approach to grounding must ultimately remain silent on. I conclude by exploring what I take to be the best option when it comes to understanding how truthmaking and grounding fit together.","[Asay, Jamin] Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong,"Asay, J (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",,,/0000-0003-1972-0035,"Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China [HKU 23400014]","Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China(Hong Kong Research Grants Council)","Versions of this paper were presented at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in August 2015 and at Yale-NUS College in Singapore in September 2015.

The possibility of realizing transparency in practice operates as a central analytical axis defining distinct positions on core theoretical problems within the field, from the security dilemma to the function of international institutions and beyond. As a political practice, the pursuit of transparent governance is a dominant feature of global politics, promoted by a wide range of actors across a vast range of issue areas, from nuclear proliferation, to internet governance, to the politics of foreign aid. Yet, despite its importance, precisely what transparency means or how the concept is understood is frequently ill-defined by academics and policymakers alike. As a result, the epistemological and ontological underpinnings of approaches to transparency in International Relations often sit in tension with their wider theoretical commitments. This article will examine the three primary understandings of transparency used in International Relations in order to unpack these commitments. It finds that while transparency is often explicitly conceptualized as a property of information, particularly within rationalist scholarship, this understanding rests upon an unarticulated set of sociological assumptions. This analysis suggests that conceptualizing transparency as information' without a wider sociology of knowledge production is highly problematic, potentially obscuring our ability to recognize transparent practices in global governance. Understanding transparency as dialogue, as a social practice rooted in shared cognitive capacities and epistemic frameworks, provides a firmer analytical ground from which to examine transparency in International Relations.","[McCarthy, Daniel R.] Univ Melbourne, Int Relat, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Fluck, Matthew] Univ Westminster, Int Relat, London, England",University of Melbourne; University of Westminster,"McCarthy, DR (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, 516 John Medley Bldg, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",Daniel.Mccarthy@unimelb.edu.au,,"McCarthy, Daniel R./0000-0003-0138-6892; Fluck, Matthew/0000-0002-9145-4803",,,,,94,28,30,0,29,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-0661,1460-3713,,EUR J INT RELAT,Eur.

In doing so he implies that experimental critiques of the reliability of intuition are based on this misunderstanding of philosophical methodology and so have little or no bearing on actual philosophical practice or results. His main point is that the orthodox understanding of philosophical methodology is incorrect in that it treats philosophical thought experiments in such a way that they can be filled in in various ways that undermines their use as counter-examples and that intuition plays no substantial role in philosophical practice when we properly understand that methodology as a result of the possibility of such filling in. In this paper Williamson's claim that philosophical thought experiments cases can be legitimately filled in this way will be challenged and it will be shown that the experimental critique of the intuition-based methods involved a serious issue.,"[Shaffer, Michael J.] St Cloud State Univ, Philosophy, St Cloud, MN 56301 USA",Minnesota State Colleges & Universities; Saint Cloud State University,"Shaffer, MJ (corresponding author), St Cloud State Univ, Philosophy, St Cloud, MN 56301 USA.",mjshaffer@stcloudstate.edu,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,0,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1742-3600,1750-0117,,EPISTEME-J INDIV SOC,Episteme,JUN,2017,14,2,,,,,255,262,,10.1017/epi.2016.15,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/epi.2016.15,,,8,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,ET9AQ,,Green Published,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000400597700008,View Full Record in Web of Science

(Linguistics and Philosophy 2002), Kratzer proposed a causal analysis of knowledge in which knowledge is defined as a form of de re belief of facts. In support of Kratzer's view, I show that a certain articulation of the de re/de dicto distinction can be used to integrally account for the original pair of Gettier cases. In contrast to Kratzer, however, I think such an account does not fundamentally require a distinction between facts and true propositions. I then discuss whether this account might be generalized and whether it can give us a reductive analysis of knowledge as de re true belief. Like Kratzer, I think it will not, in particular the distinction appears inadequate to account for Ginet-Goldman cases of causally connected but unreliable belief. Nevertheless, I argue that the de re belief analysis allows us to account for a distinction Starmans and Friedman recently introduced between apparent evidence and authentic evidence in their empirical study of Gettier cases, in a way that questions their claim that a causal disconnect is not operative in the contrasts they found.","[Egre, Paul] Ecole Normale Super, Dept Philosophie, Dept Etud Cognit, Paris Sci & Lettres,Inst Jean Nicod,CNRS ENS EHES, 29 Rue Ulm, F-75005 Paris, France; [Egre, Paul] Swedish Coll Adv Study, Uppsala, Sweden",Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS); Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study (SCAS),"Egré, P (corresponding author), Ecole Normale Super, Dept Philosophie, Dept Etud Cognit, Paris Sci & Lettres,Inst Jean Nicod,CNRS ENS EHES, 29 Rue Ulm, F-75005 Paris, France.;Egré, P (corresponding author), Swedish Coll Adv Study, Uppsala, Sweden.",paul.egre@ens.fr,,,"Department of Cognitive Studies at ENS [ANR-10-LABX-0087 IEC, ANR-10-IDEX-0001-02 PSL*]",Department of Cognitive Studies at ENS,"This is a revised and amended version of a paper that initially appeared in the Liber Amicorum Pascal Engel edited by A.

This paper analyses how intellectual virtues can be beneficial for successful resolution of theory choice. We explore the role of virtues as well as vices in scientific inquiry and their beneficial effects in the context of theory choice. We argue that vices can play a role in widening the set of potential candidate theories and support our claim with historical examples and normative arguments from formal social epistemology.

The argument proceeds from the openness of evidential support and the dependence of empirical knowledge on evidence, to the conclusion that knowledge is open. Without attempting to provide a full-fledged theory of evidence, we show that on the modest assumption that evidence cannot support both a proposition and its negation, or, alternatively, that information that reduces the probability of a proposition cannot constitute evidence for its truth, the relation of evidential support is not closed under known entailment. Therefore the evidence-for relation is deductively open regardless of whether evidence is probabilistic or not. Given even a weak dependence of empirical knowledge on evidence, we argue that empirical knowledge is also open. On this basis, we also respond to the strongest argument in support of knowledge closure (Hawthorne 2004a). Finally, we present a number of significant benefits of our position, namely, offering a unified explanation for a range of epistemological puzzles.","[Sharon, Assaf] Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Philosophy, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Spectre, Levi] Open Univ Israel, Raanana, Israel; [Spectre, Levi] Stockholm Univ, Dept Philosophy, Stockholm, Sweden",Tel Aviv University; Open University Israel; Stockholm University,"Spectre, L (corresponding author), Open Univ Israel, Raanana, Israel.;Spectre, L (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Philosophy, Stockholm, Sweden.",assafsharon@post.tau.ac.il; levi.spectre@gmail.com,"Spectre, Levi/AFK-0559-2022; Spectre, Levi/AAF-7533-2022","Spectre, Levi/0000-0002-2913-346X",,,,,41,12,12,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0031-8116,1573-0883,,PHILOS STUD,Philos.

I argue that in cases of both easy and easy(s) understanding, no aspect of understanding stands in the way of it being able to acquire it through testimony. As a result, while not all understanding can be acquired through testimony in all instances and for all subjects, this failure of acquisition is only a product of the complexity of the relevant information or one's unfamiliarity with it, and not a product of the epistemic relationship of understanding.","[Boyd, Kenneth] Dalhousie Univ, Halifax, NS, Canada",Dalhousie University,"Boyd, K (corresponding author), Dalhousie Univ, Halifax, NS, Canada.",kenneth.boyd@gmail.com,"Boyd, Kenneth/AAF-9094-2020","Boyd, Kenneth/0000-0003-1846-4324",,,,,32,23,25,0,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1742-3600,1750-0117,,EPISTEME-J INDIV SOC,Episteme,MAR,2017,14,1,,,,,103,127,,10.1017/epi.2015.53,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/epi.2015.53,,,25,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,ER1EE,,Green Submitted,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000398531600008,View Full Record in Web of Science

The main subject of interest includes the problems of the truth interpretation as a symbolic medium of scientific communication, the perspectives of the comparative analysis of the truth on a level with the media of some other communicative systems (i.e. the political system, the economy). The author explores the interdisciplinary capabilities that could have been triggered by this system-communicative theory of science. In particular, the processes of inflation/deflation are compared that characterize both the scientific and economical types of communications; the social, topical, and temporal dimensions of truth are considered what enables to reconstruct both internal and external factors in development of the scientific knowledge. Thus, the truth is conceptualized as a communicative reference point subjected to the evolution from some traditional normative expectations (first of all the prohibition of falsehood and the prohibition of oblivion) towards the contemporary media-symbol with a function to mark the knowledge newness and actuality that corresponds to some cognitive expectations i.e. the willingness to deny by certain conditions even some established generalizations and attitudes.","[Antonovskiy, Alexander Yu.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Philosophy, Moscow, Russia; [Antonovskiy, Alexander Yu.] Moscow State Lomonosow Univ, Dept Philosophy, Moscow, Russia","Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Philosophy, Russian Academy of Sciences","Antonovskiy, AY (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Inst Philosophy, Moscow, Russia.;Antonovskiy, AY (corresponding author), Moscow State Lomonosow Univ, Dept Philosophy, Moscow, Russia.",antonovski@hotmail.com,"Antonovskiy, Alexander Yu/L-7762-2013","Antonovskiy, Alexander Yu/0000-0003-4209-8213",,,,,15,12,13,1,15,MEZHDUNARODNAYA KNIGA,MOSCOW,"39 DIMITROVA UL., MOSCOW, 113095, RUSSIA",0042-8744,,,VOP FILOS,Vopr.

Design/methodology/approach - A philosophical argument based on the critique of literature. Findings - Normative epistemology implies that knowing leads to certainty, and it has to be objective and universal because it is an accurate representation of reality. Dynamic and integrative epistemology uphold that knowing leads to accumulating insights though information processing. Knowing is a unified but fourfold process of experiencing, understanding, judging and acting (Lonergan, 1990). It occurs at four levels of consciousness: the empirical, the intellectual, the evaluative and the pragmatic (Lonergan, 1990). Dynamic and integrative epistemology extends rationality, knowledge and intelligence to non-humans because institutions have substantive, structural, behavior and teleological dimensions and processes that enable themto process information, i. e. to know. Research limitations/implications - Translating a conceptual paper into practical action, organizational structuring or product design can be difficult. Practical implications - Extending the concept of rationality to non-humans implies realizing that human abilities are limited and need to be augmented by proper institutional design and artificial tools. Social implications - The design of intelligent organizations, societies and artificial tools. Originality value - Normative epistemology which considers reason and faith, empirical (experience) and rational (understanding), positive (facts) and ideal (principles, representations or wishes), physical (objects) and mental (ideas or concepts), practice and theory, knowledge (episteme) and opinion (doxa), reflection and action as opposed and mutually exclusive can be replaced by a dynamic and integrative epistemology which puts emotional, intellectual, evaluative and pragmatic dimensions of human knowing in an order of succession through a unified but yet differentiated process which can be augmented by non-human experts.","[Bigirimana, Stanislas] Africa Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Syst, Pretoria, South Africa",,"Bigirimana, S (corresponding author), Africa Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Syst, Pretoria, South Africa.",sbigirimanaus@yahoo.com,"Bigirimana, Stanislas/I-8791-2016; Bigirimana, Stanislas/HGB-1280-2022",,,,,,34,8,8,0,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0368-492X,1758-7883,,KYBERNETES,Kybernetes,,2017,46,9,,,,,1597,1610,,10.1108/K-10-2016-0275,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/K-10-2016-0275,,,14,"Computer Science, Cybernetics",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science,FO2EG,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000416586300010,View Full Record in Web of Science

The High Court has recently rejected the theory of intentionalism and, as such, has attracted criticisms from some of the theory's most eminent proponents. One of these criticisms contends that, over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, the truth of intentionalist theory formed a fundamental assumption upon which the existing framework of interpretive principles was constructed. As such, the criticism continues, the Court's rejection of intentionalism today risks, at first, the loss of our ability to justify the existing framework of interpretive principles and, then inevitably, the collapse of that framework. In this article, I will attempt to defend the High Court's position against this criticism. I will firstly argue that the criticism rests upon a false assumption: the assumption that Australia's tradition of referring to 'legislative intentions' can be equated to a tradition of accepting intentionalist theory. I will secondly argue that the established methods of interpretation are able to be adequately accommodated and justified by a non-intentionalist theory, namely textualism, a theory that the High Court has adopted in all but name.

In this regard it is shown how a cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT) perspective can be combined with a relational approach to generate the theoretical and practical tools for managing change at a school. Referring to an ongoing research project at a school, the paper describes how teachers and management there, with the aid of the researcher, attempt to re-configure their educational praxis by drawing on past, present and future scenarios from their schooling activity. These are correlated with similarly historically evolving theoretical models and recorded empirical data using the Vygotskyian method of double stimulation employed by the Change Laboratory. A relational conceptualisation of the school's epistemological, pedagogical and organisational traditions is used to map out the connections between various actors, resources, roles and divisions of labour at the school. In this way the research intervention proposes a model of educational change that graphically represents it as a network of mediated relationships so that its artefacts, practices and traditions can be clearly understood and effectively manipulated according to the shared objectives of the teachers and school management. Such a relationally-oriented activity theory approach has significant implications in terms of challenging conventional processes of educational transformation as well as hegemonic knowledge-making traditions themselves.","[Botha, Louis Royce] Univ South Africa, Med Res Council, Pretoria, South Africa",South African Medical Research Council; University of South Africa,"Botha, LR (corresponding author), Univ South Africa, Med Res Council, Pretoria, South Africa.",louis.botha2@wits.ac.za,,"Botha, Louis/0000-0001-6321-7950",,,,,43,4,8,6,25,UNISA PRESS,PRETORIA,"PO BOX 392, PRETORIA, 0003, SOUTH AFRICA",1682-3206,1947-9417,,EDUC CHANGE,Educ.

A mismatch in purpose between knowledge creation and reuse is most likely to reduce knowledge reuse effectiveness. Time pressures may lead to an increase in errors associated with search question definition as well as knowledge search and selection, while unfamiliar language is likely to lead to misinterpretations of content. Knowledge accessibility issues are of particular concern in time-sensitive situations. Authorship and creation date information may facilitate knowledge reuse by allowing consumers to filter unwanted knowledge.

Following the proposal of Tsohatzidis (2012) for 'knows', the hypothesis put forward is that sa, when used in mental state attributions, is lexically ambiguous between a factive and a non-factive sense: when sa is used in its factive sense, a sentence such as X sa che p 'X sa that p' entails p, whereas, when sa is used in its non-factive sense, a sentence having the same surface form does not entail p. This hypothesis seems to be confirmed by some tests traditionally used to ascertain cases of lexical ambiguity. Moreover, it will be shown that there are syntactic environments where only one of the two readings is allowed, which also seems to confirm the hypothesis that there are two sa, a factive one and a non-factive one, which select different structures.","[Dahlman, Roberta Colonna] Lund Univ, Ctr Languages & Literature, Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Dahlman, RC (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Ctr Languages & Literature, Lund, Sweden.",roberta.colonna.dahlman@gmail.com,,,,,,,64,3,3,0,1,PACINI EDITORE,PISA,"VIA DELLA GHERARDESCA-ZONA INDUSTRIALE OSPEDALETTO, 56121 PISA, ITALY",1120-2726,,,ITAL J LINGUIST,Ital.

This paper provides reasons for thinking not only that is this possible, but that it is conceptually advantageous and suggestive. Those reasons include adaptations of, and responses to, some classic philosophical arguments and ideas, from Descartes, Hume, Peirce, Mill, and Ryle. The paper's position is thus a practicalism - a kind of pragmatism - about the nature of knowledge, arguing that all knowledge is knowledge-how to act - to do this, to do that. Such a conception can include, too, a distinctive view of the metaphysical relation between knowledge and belief. We see that, contrary to what most contemporary epistemologists say, knowledge need not be a form of belief. Instead, a belief that p can be a way simply of enriching or strengthening knowledge that p. It can do this in a paracticalist way, by allowing one to do more with the knowledge.","[Hetherington, Stephen] Univ New South Wales, Kensington, NSW, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Hetherington, S (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Kensington, NSW, Australia.",s.hetherington@unsw.edu.au,,,,,,,40,8,8,0,2,ASSOC CULTURALE PRAGMA,ROME,"VIA OSTIENSE 234, ROME, 00146, ITALY",2036-4091,,,EUR J PRAGMAT AM PHI,Eur.

In this article, the authors explore this past-present-future conundrum by explaining how reliance on the past may restrict an organization's ability to deal with emergent situations in the future. The role of wisdom will be introduced as a bridge connecting current past-oriented knowledge to unknown and unpredictable future-oriented events.

Teachers, schools and nations are increasingly held to account based on metrics, exacerbating the tendency for fine-grained measurement of learning experiences. In this article, the origins of learning analytics ontology are explored, drawing upon core ideas in the philosophy of computing, such as the general definition of information and the information-theoretic account of knowledge. Drawing upon a reading of Descartes Meditatio II, which extends the phenomenology of Jean-Luc Marion into a pedagogy of intentionality, the article identifies a fundamental incompatibility between the subjective experience of learning and the information-theoretic account of knowledge. Human subjects experience and value their own information incommensurably with the ways in which computers measure and quantify information. The consequences of this finding for the design of online learning environments, and the necessary limitations of learning analytics and measurement are explored.","[Lundie, David] Liverpool Hope Univ, Fac Educ, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",Liverpool Hope University,"Lundie, D (corresponding author), Liverpool Hope Univ, Fac Educ, Liverpool, Merseyside, England.",lundied@hope.ac.uk,,"Lundie, David/0000-0003-2913-8962",,,,,43,6,8,0,23,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-1857,1469-5812,,EDUC PHILOS THEORY,Educ.

According to this line of reasoning, most of our normative beliefs have been strongly influenced by evolutionary forces. As evolution is a non-truth-tracking process, this influence may lead our normative beliefs off track. If so, normative realists need to provide an explanation of how it is possible that our normative beliefs track stance-independent truth, or of how their falsity could be spotted, when evolution powerfully drives us to certain judgments. The article assesses this argument, and tries to show that it is not a real threat to normative realists. Two arguments are employed. First, it is not the case that most of our normative beliefs are evolution-driven. There are relevant normative views - for instance, a principle of impartiality - which are quite recalcitrant to evolutionary explanations. Second, if the supervenience of normative on the non-normative holds, then most of our current normative beliefs track truth in the actual world and in the closest possible worlds. As a consequence, the debunking argument amounts either to the trivial remark that the truth of few beliefs is unsafe, or to a standard sceptical argument focusing on the merely logical possibility of epistemic errors.","[Pellegrino, Gianfranco] LUISS Guido Carli, Dipartimento Sci Polit, Rome, Italy",Luiss Guido Carli University,"Pellegrino, G (corresponding author), LUISS Guido Carli, Dipartimento Sci Polit, Rome, Italy.",gpellegrino@luiss.it,,,,,,,146,1,1,0,1,"UNIV STUDI TRIESTE, EDIZIONI UNIVERSITA TRIESTE-EUT",TRIESTE,"VIA EDOARDO WEISS 21, TRIESTE, 34128, ITALY",1825-5167,,,ETICA POLITICA,Etica Politica,,2017,19,2,,,,,105,140,,,,,,36,Philosophy,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Philosophy,FI0KS,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000411614800007,View Full Record in Web of Science

This observation brings to light a certain danger for the debate, namely that if participants fail to explicitly specify the ethical theory that they rely on, then the debate can seem nebulous. This raises a new question: is there an account of morality, independent of literature, which is most conducive to literary moral cognitivism, that is, which optimises literary moral cognitivism's chances of succeeding philosophically? This paper both formulates and investigates this hypothesis with reference to moral pluralism, the view that there is an irreducible plurality of foundational moral principles. It concludes that such an affinity exists, but with an important caveat: the affinity is stronger at the level of moral suggestion than the level of moral justification. This has implications for the strength of the version of literary moral cognitivism that it is ultimately plausible to endorse from a moral pluralist point of view.","[Shum, Peter] Higher Educ Acad, Heslington, England",,"Shum, P (corresponding author), Higher Educ Acad, Heslington, England.",,"Shum, Peter/H-3787-2019",,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,PENN STATE UNIV PRESS,UNIVERSITY PK,"820 NORTH UNIV DRIVE, U S B 1, STE C, UNIVERSITY PK, PA 16802 USA",1524-8429,2161-427X,,INTERDISCIP LIT STUD,Interdiscip.

The second, the process-centered approach represented by S. Orestis Palermos, employs the theory of virtue reliabilism and focuses on the group knowledge-conducive process. In the paper, I argue in favor of the latter as the internalism associated with the former appears to lack sufficient explanatory power. The theory of virtue epistemology runs into considerable difficulties when trying to deal with an extended epistemic subject composed of one individual and her cognitive artifact. In the two last parts of the paper, I consider the most important difficulties and argue that these obstacles are overcome once one adopts an approach combining virtue epistemology and the thesis of distributed group epistemic subject.(1)","[Trybulec, Barbara] Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Lublin, Poland",Maria Curie-Sklodowska University,"Trybulec, B (corresponding author), Marie Curie Sklodowska Univ, Lublin, Poland.",barbara.trybulec@poczta.umcs.lublin.pl,,"Trybulec, Barbara/0000-0001-8145-7755","National Science Centre, Poland [2014/13/D/HS1/00689]","National Science Centre, Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)","This work was realized as a part of the grant Sonata founded by National Science Centre, Poland.

Such proofs turn, not on general facts about (or features of) the world, but on appreciating various fundamental regards in which our finite human cognizance depends upon the world we inhabit. The 'transcendental' character of these analyses concerns identifying and appreciating various fundamental features of our finite form of human mindedness, and basic constraints upon, and prospects of, cognitive justification within the non-formal domain of human empirical knowledge. Such analyses and proofs have been developed in various ways, using distinctive strategies, not only by Kant, but also by Hegel, C.I. Lewis, Heidegger, Wittgenstein and Frederick Will. Here I examine and defend the methodological reflections required to understand, assess and appreciate such transcendental proofs, and why so few analytic epistemologists have found them persuasive or illuminating.","[Westphal, Kenneth R.] Bogazici Univ, Dept Philosophy, Istanbul, Turkey",Bogazici University,"Westphal, KR (corresponding author), Bogazici Univ, Dept Philosophy, Istanbul, Turkey.",ken.westphal@boun.edu.tr,"Westphal, Kenneth R./AAN-3834-2020","Westphal, Kenneth R./0000-0001-6039-760X",,,,,89,0,0,0,1,"UNIV BELGRADE, INST PHILOSOPHY & SOCIAL THEORY",BELGRADE,"KRALJICE NATALIJE 45, BELGRADE, 11000, SERBIA",0353-5738,2334-8577,,PHILOS SOC-FILOZOFIJ,Philos.

The central features of the Teleological Account are these: it is compact in its reliance on a single central explanatory posit, knowledge-centered in its insistence that knowledge sets the fundamental epistemic norm, and yet fiercely pluralistic in its acknowledgment of the legitimacy and value of a rich range of epistemic norms distinct from knowledge.

J,"Uegaki, W",,,,"Uegaki, Wataru",,,Content Nouns and the Semantics of Question-Embedding,JOURNAL OF SEMANTICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This article proposes that RESPONSIVE PREDICATES-predicates that embed both interrogatives and declaratives, such as know-select for questions (modeled as sets of propositions) rather than propositions. Declarative complements denote singleton proposition-sets, meaning that declarative-embedding is a special ('trivialized') case of question-embedding. This analysis is in contrast to the more standard analysis of responsive predicates that treats them as proposition-taking items and reduces embedded questions to propositions (Groenendijk & Stokhof 1984; Lahiri 2002). The argument is based on the semantic contrast between responsive predicates and predicates that only embed declaratives (e. g., believe), when they take DP complements headed by content nouns (Vendler 1972), as in John knows the rumor that Mary left vs. John believes the rumor that Mary left. Under the common assumption that responsive predicates are proposition-taking, any plausible predictive account of the entailment from John believes the rumor that Mary left to John believes that Mary left would run into an incorrect prediction that John knows the rumor that Mary left would also entail John knows that Mary left. On the other hand, if responsive predicates are question-taking, the contrast can be captured given an inventory of type-shifters that map entities to propositions and questions. It is also argued that the proposed analysis enables a natural semantic account of the selectional restrictions of attitude predicates: believe-type predicates select for propositions, know-type predicates select for questions, and ask/wondertype predicates select for non-singleton questions.","[Uegaki, Wataru] MIT, Dept Linguist Philosophy, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Uegaki, W (corresponding author), MIT, Dept Linguist Philosophy, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",wuegaki@mit.edu,"Uegaki, Wataru/AAZ-6298-2020","Uegaki, Wataru/0000-0003-3464-9601",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15J00143] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,35,11,14,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0167-5133,1477-4593,,J SEMANT,J.

According to the expertise defense, only the intuitions of philosophical experts count-yet the bulk of experimental philosophy consists in studies with lay people. In this paper, we argue that direct (experimental) strategies for assessing the expertise defense are preferable to indirect (inductive) strategies. A direct argument in support of the expertise defense would have to show: first, that there is a significant difference between expert and lay intuitions; second, that expert intuitions are superior to lay intuitions; and third, that expert intuitions accord with the relevant philosophical consensus. At present, there is only little experimental evidence that bears on these issues. To advance the debate, we conducted two new experiments on intuitions about knowledge with experts and lay people. Our results suggest that the intuitions of epistemological experts are superior in some respects, but they also pose an unexpected challenge to the expertise defense. Most strikingly, we found that even epistemological experts tend to ascribe knowledge in fake-barn-style cases. This suggests that philosophy, as a discipline, might fail to adequately map the intuitions of its expert practitioners onto a disciplinary consensus.","[Horvath, Joachim] Univ Cologne, Philosoph Seminar, Richard Strauss Str 2, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Wiegmann, Alex] Univ Gottingen, Georg Elias Muller Inst Psychol, Gosslerstr 14, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Cologne; University of Gottingen,"Horvath, J (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Philosoph Seminar, Richard Strauss Str 2, D-50931 Cologne, Germany.",joachim.horvath@uni-koeln.de; Alex.Wiegmann@psych.uni-goettingen.de,"Wiegmann, Alex/AAK-8407-2021","Wiegmann, Alex/0000-0002-1492-9780; Horvath, Joachim/0000-0003-2713-5135",,,,,124,45,45,1,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0031-8116,1573-0883,,PHILOS STUD,Philos.

They allege that Mill failed to demonstrate that some pleasures are lexically preferred to others, and indeed that this can be shown false by the fact that most people would not renounce supposedly lower pleasures, such as chocolate or sex, even for greater amounts of higher pleasures, such as reading or opera. I respond that many of these criticisms rest on uncharitable assumptions or interpretations of Mill's position. We need not suppose that Mill was even trying to do the things he supposedly failed to do. However, considering these objections may lead us to a more plausible interpretation of Mill's views, according to which the quality of pleasures, along with their quantity, contributes towards happiness. There is no need to suppose that higher pleasures' must be lexically preferred to lower ones, or even to be dogmatic about which pleasures are higher.","[Saunders, Ben] Univ Southampton, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Polit Philosophy, Southampton SO9 5NH, Hants, England",University of Southampton,"Saunders, B (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Polit Philosophy, Southampton SO9 5NH, Hants, England.",b.m.saunders@soton.ac.uk,,,,,,,26,1,2,0,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0031-8191,1469-817X,,PHILOSOPHY,Philosophy,OCT,2016,91,4,,,,,503,521,,10.1017/S0031819116000437,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0031819116000437,,,19,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,DZ9LJ,,Green Accepted,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000386196300004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Recently, this widespread opinion was challenged by Peter Baumann, who argues that in certain situations agents do possess knowledge even though their beliefs are true by luck. This paper aims at providing empirical data for evaluating Baumann's hypothesis. The experiment was designed to compare non-philosophers' judgments concerning knowledge and luck in one case that Baumann takes to be in favor of his claim and other cases where, according to him, absence of knowledge coincides with luck. The results show that the cases do not differ in a significant way between each other with respect to verdicts regarding knowledge and luck. In all cases subjects were more reluctant to judge that the 'Gettierized' belief is knowledge and more likely to judge that it is true by luck in comparison to a belief that is an uncontroversial instance of knowledge. However, the negative relationship between knowledge and luck ascriptions predicted by the No-Luck-Thesis was almost absent. The data raise some doubts about the No-Luck-Thesis, but the reasons for doubt are different than what Baumann expected.","[Ziolkowski, Adrian] Univ Warsaw, PL-00325 Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Ziólkowski, A (corresponding author), Univ Warsaw, PL-00325 Warsaw, Poland.",adrian.a.ziolkowski@gmail.com,,,,,,,12,2,3,0,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1742-3600,1750-0117,,EPISTEME-J INDIV SOC,Episteme,SEP,2016,13,3,,,,,343,358,,10.1017/epi.2015.49,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/epi.2015.49,,,16,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,ED1SZ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000388626500006,View Full Record in Web of Science

The question of whether and how beliefs about vaccination are linked to political ideology has been hotly debated. This study investigates the effects of ideology on perceptions of harms and benefits related to vaccination as well as judgments of others' attitudes. A total of 367 U.S. adults (131 men, 236 women; M-age = 34.92 years, range = 18-72) completed an online survey through Mechanical Turk. Results revealed that liberals were significantly more likely to endorse pro-vaccination statements and to regard them as facts (rather than beliefs), in comparison with moderates and conservatives. Whereas conservatives overestimated the proportion of like-minded others who agreed with them, liberals underestimated the proportion of others who agreed with them. That is, conservatives exhibited the truly false consensus effect, whereas liberals exhibited an illusion of uniqueness with respect to beliefs about vaccination. Conservative and moderate parents in this sample were less likely than liberals to report having fully vaccinated their children prior to the age of two. A clear limitation of this study is that the sample is not representative of the U.S. population. Nevertheless, a recognition of ideological sources of potential variability in health-related beliefs and perceptions is a prerequisite for the design of effective forms of public communication.","[Rabinowitz, Mitchell; Latella, Lauren] Fordham Univ, Grad Sch Educ, New York, NY 10023 USA; [Stern, Chadly] Univ Illinois, Dept Psychol, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Jost, John T.] NYU, Dept Psychol, 6 Washington Pl, New York, NY 10003 USA",Fordham University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; New York University,"Rabinowitz, M (corresponding author), Fordham Univ, Grad Sch Educ, New York, NY 10023 USA.",mrabinowitz@fordham.edu,"Jost, John T/JBS-6965-2023","Jost, John T/0000-0002-2844-4645; Rabinowitz, Mitchell/0000-0002-8774-5288",,,,,60,58,64,0,23,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,JUL 8,2016,11,7,,,,,,,e0158382,10.1371/journal.pone.0158382,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0158382,,,19,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics,DR6IK,27391965,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Published",,,2024-07-12,WOS:000380005400049,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, this condition has typically simply been taken for granted rather than argued for. The condition is not necessary for ensuring that participants are jointly responsible for the action in which each participates, nor for ensuring that each treats the others as partners rather than as social tools. It is thus something of a mystery why the condition is so widely accepted. By rejecting three arguments that could potentially support it, I argue that reductionists should get rid of the condition. I show that two of the arguments fail.

J,"Whittington, LJ",,,,"Whittington, Lee John",,,"Luck, knowledge and value",SYNTHESE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Luck; Significance; Epistemic value; Epistemic luck; Anti-luck epistemology,PRAGMATIC ENCROACHMENT,"In a recent set of publications Ballantyne (Can J Philos 41(4):485-503, 2011, Synthese 185(3):319-334, 2012, Synthese 91(7):1391-1407, 2013) argues that luck does not have a significant role in understanding the concept of knowledge. The problem, Ballantyne argues, lies in what is commonly thought to be a necessary condition for luck-a significance or value condition (Pritchard, in Epistemic luck, 2005; Coffman, in Synthese 15(3):385-398, 2007; Lackey, in Austral J Philos 86(2):255-267, 2008, Ballantyne, in Can J Philos 41(4):485-503, 2011). For an event, like forming a true belief, to be lucky then it must be of some significance or value to an agent. Yet, if significance, as it has also been commonly thought, plays a role in determining the degree of luck (Pritchard and Smith, in New Ideas Psychol 22:1-28, 2004; Ballantyne, in Can J Philos 41(4):485-503, 2011), then this leads to a result similar to (but not the same as) an absurd form of pragmatic encroachment. If this problem cannot be avoided, then anti-luck epistemology should be abandoned. However, this paper will argue that with proper considerations about the nature of luck according to at least one theory, no such problem arises.","[Whittington, Lee John] Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Whittington, LJ (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",l.j.whittington@sms.ed.ac.uk,,,,,,,31,5,6,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0039-7857,1573-0964,,SYNTHESE,Synthese,JUN,2016,193,6,,,,,1615,1633,,10.1007/s11229-015-0794-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11229-015-0794-1,,,19,History & Philosophy Of Science; Philosophy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),History & Philosophy of Science; Philosophy,DM0LM,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000376036300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Lawmakers and scholars assume that factfinders need fundamentally different procedures for attributing mental states to corporations and individuals. As a result, they saddle themselves with unjustifiable theories of mental state attribution, like respondeat superior, that produce results wholly at odds with all the major theories of the objectives of criminal law. This Article draws on recent findings in cognitive science to develop a new, comprehensive approach to corporate mens rea that would better allow corporate criminal law to fulfill its deterrent, retributive, and expressive aims. It does this by letting factfinders attribute mental states to corporations at trial as they ordinarily do to similar groups out of the courtroom. Under this new approach, factfinders would be asked to treat corporate defendants much like natural person defendants. Rather than atomize corporations into individual employees, factfinders would view them holistically. Then, factfinders could do just what they do for natural people-in light of surrounding circumstances and other corporate acts, infer what mental state most likely accompanied the act at issue. Such a theory harmonizes with recent cognitive scientific findings on mental state and responsibility attribution, developments that corporate liability scholars have mostly ignored.","[Diamantis, Mihailis E.] Univ Iowa, Coll Law, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Diamantis, Mihailis E.] Columbia Law Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA",University of Iowa; Columbia University,"Diamantis, ME (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, Coll Law, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.;Diamantis, ME (corresponding author), Columbia Law Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA.",,,"Diamantis, Mihailis/0000-0001-6865-9301",,,,,210,19,20,1,7,NOTRE DAME LAW SCHOOL,NOTRE DAME,"NOTRE DAME LAW SCHOOL, ROOM B1, NOTRE DAME, IN 46556 USA",0745-3515,,,NOTRE DAME LAW REV,Notre Dame Law Rev.,MAY,2016,91,5,,,,,2049,2090,,,,,,42,Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Government & Law,DZ5KH,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000385900500009,View Full Record in Web of Science

I sketch the advantages of a virtue-based account of knowledge-how and consider whether we should prefer a reliabilist or a responsibilist virtue-account of knowledge-how. I argue that only a responsibilist account will maintain the crucial distinction between knowing how to do something and merely being able to do it. Such an account, I hold, must incorporate learning how to do something' as an essential part. Drawing on an argument by Craig, I hold that the function of the concept of knowing how is to mark out practical experts whom one can trust either to (1) perform an action on one's behalf, or (2) to teach one how to perform that action oneself. The best way to identify practical experts, I hold, is to discover what they have learned about performing the action in question.

Yet that focus re-emerges, especially among reliabilist' virtue epistemologists. I argue for a more responsibilist' approach and for the importance of some of the quieter and gentler epistemic virtues, by contrast with the tough-minded ones that are currently popular in education. In particular I make a case for what I here call unknowing': a positive state that is not the same as ignorance. I acknowledge the mystical connotations of the term, and suggest that there is a strong interest in unknowing in writers such as Plato, Kierkegaard and Nietzsche. In their style of philosophising they also address the paradox of being knowing about unknowingness itself.","[Smith, Richard] Univ Durham, Sch Educ, Durham DH1 1TA, England",Durham University,"Smith, R (corresponding author), Univ Durham, Sch Educ, Durham DH1 1TA, England.",r.d.smith@durham.ac.uk,,,,,,,34,20,23,2,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-8249,1467-9752,,J PHILOS EDUC,J.

According to the Evolutionary Objection, the fact that evolutionary pressures have influenced our moral beliefs implies a similar coincidence. After distinguishing these epistemological critiques, I provide an extensive defense of the Causal Objection that also strengthens the Evolutionary Objection. In particular, I formulate a Master Causal Objection featuring the controversial premise that non-naturalism can provide no adequate explanation for moral knowledge. I defend this premise by first narrowing down the range of candidate explanations to conceptual, constitutive, and evolutionary explanations, and then considering and eliminating each of these in turn.

One very common one is by supporting ideas we like. We label them correct and we act to dismiss doubts about them. We take sides about ideas and theories as if that was the right thing to do. And yet, from a rational point of view, this type of support and belief is not justifiable. The best we can hope when describing the real world, as far as we know today, is to have probabilistic knowledge. In practice, estimating a real probability can be too hard to achieve but that just means we have more uncertainty, not less. There are ideas we defend that define, in our minds, our own identity. And recent experiments have been showing that we stop being able to analyze competently those propositions we hold so dearly. In this paper, I gather the evidence we have about taking sides and present the obvious but unseen conclusion that these facts combined mean that we should actually never believe in anything about the real world, except in a probabilistic way. We must actually never take sides since taking sides compromise our abilities to seek for the most correct description of the world. That means we need to start reformulating the way we debate ideas, from our teaching to our political debates. Here, I will show the logical and experimental basis of this conclusion. I will also show, by presenting new models for the evolution of opinions, that our desire to have something to believe is probably behind the emergence of extremism in debates. And we will see how this problem can even have an impact in the reliability of whole scientific fields. The crisis around p-values is discussed and much better understood under the light of this paper results. Finally, I will debate possible consequences and ideas on how to deal with this problem.","[Martins, Andre C.

Understood in terms of theoretical knowledge (or knowledge- that), however, it faces the arguably insurmountable problems of relativism and superstition. The educational implications of this would be that mere beliefs or opinions unanchored by reason(s), such as bald assertions, superstitions, prejudice and bias, should not be included in the curriculum, at least not under the guise of knowledge. Worthy of inclusion are skills and practical knowledge, as are traditional music, art, dance and folklore (qua folklore). Moreover, anything that meets the essential requirements for knowledge-that could in principle be included. Against this understanding of knowledge, and its educational implications, it has been contended that indigenous knowledge places no special emphasis on belief, evidence or truth, but that, according to indigenous practitioners, it is rather the way that constitutes knowledge, harmonious interaction and appropriate models of conduct. It has been argued, further, that cognitive states are (to be) seen as maps, as useful and practical action-guides. This is why (so the argument for polycentric epistemologies or polycentric global epistemology goes) divination, rain-making, rain-discarding, shamanism, sorcery, ceremony, ritual, mysticism, etc., must be acknowledged as ways of knowing (and as educationally valuable) alongside animal husbandry, botany, medicine, mathematics, tool-making, and the like. The present paper investigates whether the way-based epistemological response is a plausible reply to the truth-based critique of indigenous knowledge (systems).","[Horsthemke, Kai] Kathol Univ Eichstatt, Bildungsphilosophie & Systemat Padag, Ostenstr 26, D-85072 Eichstatt, Germany",,"Horsthemke, K (corresponding author), Kathol Univ Eichstatt, Bildungsphilosophie & Systemat Padag, Ostenstr 26, D-85072 Eichstatt, Germany.",Kai.Horsthemke@ku.de,,,,,,,30,1,1,0,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2227-7102,,,EDUC SCI,Educ.

However, on the one hand little is known on what justification precisely means to scientists, and on the other the position held by philosophers of science on what it entails is rather limited; for justifications customarily refer to the written form (textual expressions) of scientific claims, leaving aside images, which, as many cases from the history of science show are relevant to this process. The fact that images can visually express scientific claims independently from text, plus their vast variety and origins, requires an assessment of the way they are currently justified and in turn used as sources to justify scientific claims in the case of particular scientific fields. Similarly, in view of the different nature of images, analysis is required to determine on what side of the philosophical distinction between data and phenomena these different kinds of images fall. This paper historicizes and documents a particular aspect of contemporary life sciences research: the use of the molecular image as vehicle of knowledge production in cell studies, a field that has undergone a significant shift in visual expressions from the early 1980s onwards. Focussing on textbooks as sources that have been overlooked in the historiography of contemporary biomedicine, the aim is to explore (1) whether the shift of cell studies, entailing a superseding of the optical image traditionally conceptualised as primary data, by the molecular image, corresponds with a shift of justificatory practices, and (2) to assess the role of the molecular image as primary data. This paper also explores the dual role of images as teaching resources and as resources for the construction of knowledge in cell studies especially in its relation to discovery and justification. Finally, this paper seeks to stimulate reflection on what kind of archival resources could benefit the work of present and future epistemic historians in particular those interested on the role of images as sources of training and knowledge production in scientific disciplines.

In this paper, I first bring out various problems with Hilary Kornblith's argument from the causal-explanatory indispensability of knowledge to the natural kindhood of knowledge. I then criticize the argument from the natural kindhood of knowledge against the method of conceptual analysis in the theory of knowledge. A natural motivation for this argument is the following seemingly plausible principle: if knowledge is a natural kind, then the concept of knowledge is a natural kind concept. Since this principle lacks adequate support, the crucial semantic claim that the concept of knowledge is a natural kind concept must be defended in some more direct way. However, there are two striking epistemic disanalogies between the concept of knowledge and paradigmatic natural kind concepts that militate against this semantic claim. Conceptual analyses of knowledge are not affected by total error, and the proponents of such analyses are not subject to a priori conceptual obliviousness. I conclude that the argument from natural kindhood does not succeed in undermining the use of conceptual analysis in the theory of knowledge.","[Horvath, Joachim] Univ Cologne, Dept Philosophy, Richard Str Str 2, D-50931 Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Horvath, J (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Dept Philosophy, Richard Str Str 2, D-50931 Cologne, Germany.",joachim.horvath@uni-koeln.de,,"Horvath, Joachim/0000-0003-2713-5135",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft DFG (German Research Foundation); DFG,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft DFG (German Research Foundation)(German Research Foundation (DFG)); DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"I would like to thank Brendan Balcerak Jackson, Thomas Grundmann, Frank Hofmann, Jonathan Jenkins Ichikawa, Stan Husi, Jens Kipper, Hilary Kornblith, Kirk Michaelian, Wolfgang Schwarz, Anand Vaidya, and various anonymous reviewers for numerous helpful comments on this paper and its non-identical predecessors.

I consider a number of explanations of this feature that draw on the metaphysics and the epistemology of personal identity, none of which prove to be satisfactory. I then argue that in order to give an adequate explanation, one needs to recognize an important characteristic of our concept of personal identity: it is such that if there are mental substances (or the like), they constitute personal identity. At the same time, there can still be persons if there are no such substances. Since this finding casts doubts on the way that thought experiments about personal identity are usually set up, I end by outlining its potential consequences for the debate over the identity of persons.","[Kipper, Jens] Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Kipper, J (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany.",jens.kipper@uni-koeln.de,,"Kipper, Jens/0000-0002-8138-0855",,,,,41,2,2,0,1,MICHIGAN PUBLISHING,ANN ARBOR,"839 GREENE ST, ANN ARBOR, MI 48104 USA",2330-4014,,,ERGO-ANN ARBOR,Ergo,,2016,3,,,,,,1,26,,10.3998/ergo.12405314.0003.001,http://dx.doi.org/10.3998/ergo.12405314.0003.001,,,26,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,VH5TT,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-07-12,WOS:000453525900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The author defends the view that scepticism is not a homogenous doctrine, but a general label for heterogenous ways of sceptical argumentation. Sceptical argumentation is, in turn, understood to include any kind of philosophically relevant argument which aims at calling into doubt epistemically-valued qualities, especially knowledge. In the second part of the article the author focuses on the question of what constitutes the intrinsic value of philosophical scepticism. The author defends the thesis that philosophical scepticism has instrumental value as a tool for understanding knowledge. This thesis is the result of the application of a particularist approach to the problem of knowledge. Scepticism provides the material for thought experiments in the context of which findings about epistemic intuitions connected with knowledge can be revealed. In spite of this, scepticism is of value only in the form of a means and its value cannot be reduced to the value of other elements.","[Nuhlicek, Martin] Univ Komenskeho Bratislave, Filozoficka Fak, Bratislava, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Nuhlícek, M (corresponding author), Univ Komenskeho Bratislave, Filozoficka Fak, Bratislava, Slovakia.",martin.nuhlicek@uniba.sk,,"Nuhlicek, Martin/0000-0002-7570-5318",,,,,24,0,0,0,1,FILOSOFICKY CASOPIS INST PHILOSOPHY,PRAGUE,"JILSKA 1, PRAGUE 110 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",0015-1831,,,FILOS CAS,Filos.

Consequently, Bernier turns out to be just as committed to internalism as those he attempts to rescue from it.

Their case rested entirely upon the crippling Gettier-style counterexamples to internalism and, by extension, critical realism. Yet, Gettier never makes an appearance in Bernier's article. One can only speculate why Bernier would write an article-length response that neglects to address this argument.

He was convinced of this because he thought that, in cases of clear perception, one could come to know that P even if one's justification for believing P was defeated. The idea is that the epistemic strength of clear perception is sufficient to provide knowledge even where justification is lacking; perceiving (and believing) that P is sufficient for knowing that P. In this paper, I explore a claim about knowledge that is the opposite side of the coin from Alston's position: clear perception (with belief) that P is necessary for knowledge. Taking my cue from John Locke, I examine the plausibility of a theory of knowledge that distinguishes justified true unGettiered belief that P from knowing that P.

Fugus are interesting intermediate cases that shed light on the following issues: bare evidentialism, false pleasure, philosophy of education, and the ethics of argument. Normally, a fugu will not yield knowledge from known premises. But if the reasoning is only slightly fallacious, they do yield knowledge. These mild fugus show that we can gain knowledge by invalid reasoning. This is a conservative resource for historians. They want to credit discoveries to Euclid rather than those who made minor corrections to his proofs, such as David Hilbert. We also benefit from this practice of grandfathering in old standards of knowledge attribution. For we can compete spiritedly for priority.

Speaking of compatibility with the agent's justified beliefs is potentially ambiguous: either of the two relations or can be meant. I discuss the possibility of identifying the relation of epistemic accessibility (for all the agent knows in , she is in ) with the union of and . Neither Gettier's examples nor the 'fake barn' cases contradict this identification. However, the proposal leads to justification equivalent scenarios being symmetric with respect to knowledge: we cannot know a true proposition in a scenario if it is false in a justification equivalent scenario. This analysis may appear to render non-trivial knowledge impossible. This conclusion follows if the extra premise is granted that for all relevant true propositions there is a justification equivalent scenario in which the proposition is false. I provide a meaning-theoretic argument against this premise.

By asserting, we share knowledge, coordinate behavior, and advance collective inquiry. Accordingly, assertion is of considerable interest to cognitive scientists, social scientists, and philosophers. This paper advances our understanding of the norm of assertion. Prior evidence suggests that knowledge is the norm of assertion, a view known as the knowledge account. In its strongest form, the knowledge account says that knowledge is both necessary and sufficient for assertability: you should make an assertion if and only if you know that it is true. The knowledge account has been rejected on the grounds that it conflicts with our ordinary practice of evaluating assertions. This paper reports four experiments that address an important objection of this sort, which focuses on a class of examples known as Gettier cases. The results undermine the objection and, in the process, provide further evidence for the knowledge account. The findings also teach some important general lessons about intuitional methodology and the curation of genres of thought experiment.","[Turri, John] Univ Waterloo, Dept Philosophy, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Turri, John] Univ Waterloo, Cognit Sci Program, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Waterloo; University of Waterloo,"Turri, J (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Dept Philosophy, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.;Turri, J (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Cognit Sci Program, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",john.turri@gmail.com,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Ontario Ministry of Economic Development and Innovation,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Ontario Ministry of Economic Development and Innovation,"For feedback, I thank Wesley Buckwalter, David Rose, and Angelo Turri.

Many definitions of information have been proposed, but little work has been done to determine which definitions are most coherent or useful. Consequently, doubts have been cast on the necessity and possibility of finding a definition. In response to these doubts, the paper shows how items and events central to IS are adequately described by Floridi's conception of information, and demonstrates how it helps clarify the muddy theoretical framework resulting from the many previous definitions. To this end, it analyzes definitions, popular in IS, that conceive of information as energy, processes, knowledge, and physical objects. The paper finds that each of these definitions produces problematic or counterintuitive implications that the GDI suitably accounts for. It discusses the role of truth in IS, notes why the GDI is preferable to its truth-requiring variant, and ends with comments about the import of such a theory for IS research and practice.","[Dinneen, Jesse David] McGill Univ, Sch Informat Studies, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada; [Brauner, Christian] Univ Tubingen, Dept Psychol, Evolutionary Cognit, Tubingen, Germany",McGill University; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Dinneen, JD (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Sch Informat Studies, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada.",,"Dinneen, Jesse David/AAF-4906-2019","Dinneen, Jesse David/0000-0001-5214-5891",,,,,77,12,13,1,64,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV PRESS,BALTIMORE,"JOURNALS PUBLISHING DIVISION, 2715 NORTH CHARLES ST, BALTIMORE, MD 21218-4363 USA",0024-2594,1559-0682,,LIBR TRENDS,Libr.

Disinformation can cause significant harm if people are misled by it. In order to address this critical threat to information quality, we first need to understand exactly what disinformation is. This paper surveys the various analyses of this concept that have been proposed by information scientists and philosophers (most notably, Luciano Floridi). It argues that these analyses are either too broad (that is, that they include things that are not disinformation), or too narrow (they exclude things that are disinformation), or both. Indeed, several of these analyses exclude important forms of disinformation, such as true disinformation, visual disinformation, side-effect disinformation, and adaptive disinformation. After considering the shortcomings of these analyses, the paper argues that disinformation is misleading information that has the function of misleading. Finally, in addition to responding to Floridi's claim that such a precise analysis of disinformation is not necessary, it briefly discusses how this analysis can help us develop techniques for detecting disinformation and policies for deterring its spread.","[Fallis, Don] Univ Arizona, Informat Resources, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Fallis, Don] Univ Arizona, Philosophy, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",University of Arizona; University of Arizona,"Fallis, D (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Informat Resources, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",,,,Social and Behavioral Sciences Research Institute at UA,Social and Behavioral Sciences Research Institute at UA,"For helpful feedback on earlier versions of this paper I would like to thank Allen Buchanan, Blaise Cronin, Andrew Dillon, Tony Doyle, Kenny Easwaran, Luciano Floridi, Martin Fricke, Jonathan Furner, Richard Fyffe, Ken Herold, Birger Hjorland, Phyllis Illari, Cheryl Knott, Jens-Erik Mai, Neil Manson, Kay Mathiesen, Ken McAllister, Patti Montiel Overall, Bruce Schneier, Yotam Shmargad, David Livingstone Smith, Sille Obelitz Soe, Dan Zelinski, my graduate seminar on Misinformation and Disinformation, the anonymous referees for the iConference, and audiences at the School of Information Resources and Library Science at the University of Arizona (UA), the Philosophy Club at UA, a Workshop on Information Quality at the University of Hertfordshire, the 2009 Pacific Division Meeting of the American Philosophical Association, the 2009 iConference, the 2010 annual meeting of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, the 2013 Security and Human Behavior conference, and the 2014 iConference.

I first introduce several competing proposals for the content of our judgement, and explain why they are inadequate. I then advance an alternative view. I argue that when we hear vignettes we consider the normal instances of the vignette. If the normal instance of the vignette exhibits a counter-instance, the vignette constitutes a challenge to the target theory. I argue that this proposal shows how responses to vignettes are an ordinary, everyday judgement, and I explain how the proposal avoids the problems generated by competing theories.

Kuhlthau's 7-stage Information Search Process (ISP) model forms the conceptual framework for the study. The aim of the study was to define an end game for the ISP model by answering the following question: How do the student participants' feelings, thoughts, and information behavior lead to the construction of new knowledge? Study findings tentatively indicate that knowledge construction results from an iterative process between the student and information, which can be divided into 3 phases. In the first phase, the students formulate questions from their previous knowledge to start knowledge construction; in the second phase, newly found topic information causes students to ask questions; and in the third phase, the students answer the questions asked by this newly found topic information. Based on these results and Kuhlthau's own ISP stage 7 assessment definition of the ISP model end game, we propose a model of knowledge construction inserted as an extra row in the ISP model framework.","[Cole, Charles; Beheshti, Jamshid; Abuhimed, Dhary; Lamoureux, Isabelle] McGill Univ, Sch Informat Studies, Montreal, PQ H3A 1X1, Canada",McGill University,"Cole, C (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Sch Informat Studies, 3661 Peel St, Montreal, PQ H3A 1X1, Canada.",charles.cole@mcgill.ca; jamshid.beheshti@mcgill.ca; dhary.abuhimed@mail.mcgill.ca; isabelle.lamoureux1@mail.mcgill.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) [410-2010-0983],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)CGIAR),We would like to thank the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) for their generous support for our research program (File 410-2010-0983).,,85,13,14,0,55,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2330-1635,2330-1643,,J ASSOC INF SCI TECH,,NOV,2015,66,11,,,,,2249,2266,,10.1002/asi.23300,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asi.23300,,,18,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Information Science & Library Science",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science,CU0NC,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000363213000007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Instead, I suggest that philosophical arguments should be based on formal-computational models to (a) reduce the ambiguities and uncertainties that come with intuitive arguments and reasoning, and (b) capture the dynamic nature of many philosophical concepts. I present a model of knowledge and belief that lends itself to being implemented on computers. Its purpose is to resolve terminological confusion in favor of a more transparent account.

In this paper we draw attention to an additional and largely ignored role that thought experiments frequently play in our philosophical practice: some thought experiments do not merely serve as means for testing various philosophical hypotheses or theories, but also serve as facilitators for conceiving and articulating new ones. As we will put it, they serve as 'heuristics for theory discovery'. Our purpose in the paper is two-fold: (i) to make a case that this additional role of thought experiments deserves the attention of philosophers interested in the methodology of philosophy; (ii) to sketch a tentative taxonomy of a number of distinct ways in which philosophical thought experiments can aid (and historically have aided) theory discovery, which can guide future research on this role of thought experiments.","[Praem, Sara Kier; Steglich-Petersen, Asbjorn] Aarhus Univ, Dept Culture & Soc, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Praëm, SK (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Culture & Soc, Jens Chr Skous Vej 5, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark.",ifiskp@cas.au.dk; filasp@cas.au.dk,,,"Danish Council for Independent Research, as part of the project 'Epistemology of Modality: Six Investigations'; John Templeton Foundation; 'New Insights and Directions for Religious Epistemology'-project at the University of Oxford","Danish Council for Independent Research, as part of the project 'Epistemology of Modality: Six Investigations'; John Templeton Foundation; 'New Insights and Directions for Religious Epistemology'-project at the University of Oxford","Earlier versions of this paper were presented at Aarhus University (2012; 2014), University of Copenhagen (2013), and University of Southern Denmark (2013).

The burden of the argument is to show that there is a plausible construal of the notions of epistemic entitlement and adequate explanation on which the resulting characterization of epistemic luck, though admittedly programmatic, has several important virtues. It avoids difficulties which plague modal accounts of epistemic luck; it can explain the conflicting temptations one can feel in certain alleged cases of epistemic luck; it offers a novel account of the value of knowledge, without committing itself to any particular analysis of knowledge; and it illuminates the significance for epistemology of the phenomenon of epistemic luck itself.","Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Goldberg, S (corresponding author), Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",,,"Goldberg, Sanford/0000-0001-9496-6356",,,,,33,16,18,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0031-8205,1933-1592,,PHILOS PHENOMEN RES,Philos.

For example, in 1807 the infamous 'idealist' Hegel argued cogently that any tenable philosophical theory of knowledge must take the natural and social sciences into very close consideration, which he himself did. Here I argue that Hegel ably and insightfully defends Newton's causal realism about gravitational force, in part by exposing a fatal equivocation in the traditional concept of substance, by criticizing some still-standard empiricist misconceptions of force, by emphasizing the role of explanatory integration in Newtonian mechanics, and by using his powerful semantics of singular, specifically cognitive reference to justify fallibilism regarding empirical justification, together with the semantic core of Newton's Rule Four of (experimental) Philosophy-in a way that highlights a key fallacy in many arguments against realism, both in epistemology and within philosophy of science.","Bogazici Univ, Dept Philosophy, TR-34342 Bebek, Turkey",Bogazici University,"Westphal, KR (corresponding author), Bogazici Univ, Dept Philosophy, TR-34342 Bebek, Turkey.",westphal.k.r@gmail.com,"Westphal, Kenneth R./AAN-3834-2020","Westphal, Kenneth R./0000-0001-6039-760X",,,,,121,4,4,0,6,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2152-5188,2156-6240,,HOPOS,HOPOS,FAL,2015,5,2,,,,,281,317,,10.1086/682374,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/682374,,,37,History & Philosophy Of Science,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),History & Philosophy of Science,CQ6BO,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000360689600004,View Full Record in Web of Science

This article proposes several metaphilosophical theses: Intuitions are not a fundamental source of evidence for philosophical theses, but are instead themselves in need of justification.

ES has been appealed to most prominently in order to explain why epistemic evaluations that conflict with the knowledge norm of assertion and practical reasoning nevertheless seem correct. Opponents of such a view are committed to what I call epistemic monism (EM), which states that there is only one way we can be properly evaluated as epistemically appropriate asserters and practical reasoners, namely in terms of whether we have adhered to or violated the relevant norm. Accepting ES over EM has two significant consequences: first, a metaepistemological consequence that the structure of normative epistemic evaluations parallels that found in other normative areas (namely, moral evaluations), and second, that the knowledge norms of assertion and practical reasoning are no worse off than any alternatives in terms of either explanatory power or simplicity.","Univ Toronto, Dept Philosophy, Toronto, ON M5R 2M8, Canada",University of Toronto,"Boyd, K (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Dept Philosophy, 170 St George St,4th Floor, Toronto, ON M5R 2M8, Canada.",kenneth.boyd@utoronto.ca,,"Boyd, Kenneth/0000-0003-1846-4324",,,,,20,5,5,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0031-8116,1573-0883,,PHILOS STUD,Philos.

Participants were less likely to ascribe knowledge for beliefs based on probabilistic evidence than for beliefs based on perceptual evidence (Experiments 1 and 2A) or testimony providing causal information (Experiment 2B). Denial of knowledge for beliefs based on probabilistic evidence did not arise because participants viewed such beliefs as unjustified, nor because such beliefs leave open the possibility of error. These findings rule out traditional philosophical accounts for why probabilistic evidence does not produce knowledge. The experiments instead suggest that people deny knowledge because they distrust drawing conclusions about an individual based on reasoning about the population to which it belongs, a tendency previously identified by judgment and decision making researchers. Consistent with this, participants were more willing to ascribe knowledge for beliefs based on probabilistic evidence that is specific to a particular case (Experiments 3A and 3B).","[Friedman, Ori] Univ Waterloo, Dept Psychol, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada; [Turri, John] Univ Waterloo, Dept Philosophy, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Waterloo; University of Waterloo,"Turri, J (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Dept Philosophy, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",friedman@uwaterloo.ca; john.turri@gmail.com,"Friedman, Ori/K-5429-2012","Friedman, Ori/0000-0003-2346-9787",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Early Researcher Award from the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development and Innovation,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Early Researcher Award from the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development and Innovation,OF's contributions to this research were supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; JT's contributions to this research were supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and an Early Researcher Award from the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development and Innovation.,,59,17,17,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0364-0213,1551-6709,,COGNITIVE SCI,Cogn.

I defend the claim that sceptical criticisms of epistemic externalism are generally wrong, because the conclusion which they infer from available premises is too strong. However, I suggest that epistemic externalism can be effectively criticized to be implausible, but for different reasons. I introduce a second type of criticisms which I call practical criticisms of epistemic externalism.

In most of the recent literature, indirect analyses are advocated according to which in such cases the clauses headed by wenn ('if') are adverbial clauses with a conditional interpretation and not real argument-clauses of the embedding verb. I argue in this paper that an argument-analysis is more advantageous for a systematic group of cases. I will propose a slight modification of the semantics of the standard conditional complementizer which will allow to capture its natural distribution between the two other main argument complementizers: dass ('that') and ob ('whether').

We tested these predictions using a paradigm based on semantic integration. We coded the frequencies with which participants falsely recalled the word thought as knew (or a near synonym), yielding an implicit measure of conceptual activation. Our experiments confirmed the predictions of our Bayesian account of knowledge attribution across three experiments. We found that Gettier cases due to counterfeit objects were not treated as knowledge (Experiment 1), but those due to intentionally-replaced evidence were (Experiment 2). Our findings are not well explained by an alternative account focused only on luck, because accidentally-replaced evidence activated the knowledge concept more strongly than did similar false belief cases (Experiment 3). We observed a consistent pattern of results across a number of different vignettes that varied the quality and type of evidence available to agents, the relative stakes involved, and surface details of content. Accordingly, the present findings establish basic phenomena surrounding people's knowledge attributions in Gettier cases, and provide explanations of these phenomena within a Bayesian framework.

On our account, if P is a responsive predicate and Q a question embedded under P, then the meaning of 'P + Q' is, informally, to be in the relation expressed by P to some potential complete answer to Q. We show that this rule allows us to derive veridical and non-veridical readings of embedded questions, depending on whether the embedding verb is veridical or not, and provide novel empirical evidence supporting the generalization. We then enrich our basic proposal to account for the presuppositions induced by the embedding verbs, as well as for the generation of intermediate exhaustive readings of embedded questions (Klinedinst and Rothschild in Semant Pragmat 4:1-23, 2011).","[Spector, Benjamin; Egre, Paul] PSL Res Univ, Inst Jean Nicod ENS EHSS CNRS, Ecole Normale Super, Dept Etud Cognit, Paris, France; [Egre, Paul] PSL Res Univ, Inst Jean Nicod ENS EHSS CNRS, Ecole Normale Super, Dept Philosophie, Paris, France",Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS); Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS),"Spector, B (corresponding author), PSL Res Univ, Inst Jean Nicod ENS EHSS CNRS, Ecole Normale Super, Dept Etud Cognit, Paris, France.",spector.benjamin@gmail.com,"Spector, Benjamin/M-9885-2015","Spector, Benjamin/0000-0003-0468-5986","Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-10-LABX-0087 IEC, ANR-10-IDEX-0001-02 PSL, ANR-14-CE30-0010-01 TriLogMean]",Agence Nationale de la Recherche(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"The research leading to these results has received support from the Agence Nationale de la Recherche (Grants ANR-10-LABX-0087 IEC, ANR-10-IDEX-0001-02 PSL and ANR-14-CE30-0010-01 TriLogMean).

Scott Shapiro has sustained this account in a particularly relevant way: the word 'law' displays a ubiquitous ambiguity, sometimes designates a set of norms and other a social organization. This is precisely the thesis which is criticized in the paper. It is argued, from a certain philosophical literature about the concepts, that concepts of social objects of intentional character (as it is the case for law, but also for literary works for example) contain a social dimension and a meaning dimension, normative in the case of the law. That is to say, the concept of law expresses a social dimension and a normative dimension intertwined.","[Moreso, J.

From this it follows that introspective knowledge, the mind's direct knowledge of its own states, is a case of displaced perception - that is, knowledge of mental (i. e., representational) facts through an awareness of external (i. e., physical) objects. In an earlier work, Dretske presents a general account of knowledge which is intended to circumvent Gettier-type counterexamples. According to this view, S knows that P if and only if: (1) S believes, without doubt, reservation, or question, that P is the case; (2) P is the case; (3) S has a reason, R, for believing that P such that, if P were not the case, then S would not have R (i. e., S has a conclusive reason, R, for believing that P). In this paper, my aim is to explore the relation between these two theories.

One of the earlier influential papers that gave rise to the experimental philosophy movement titled 'Normativity and Epistemic Intuitions' by Jonathan M. Weinberg, Shaun Nichols and Stephen Stich (2001), reported that respondents displayed different epistemic intuitions depending on their ethnic background as well as socioeconomic status. These findings, if robust, would have important implications for philosophical methodology in general and epistemology in particular. Because of the important implication of its findings, Weinberg et al. (2001) has been very influential - currently with more than four hundred citations - and the subject of extensive debate. Despite the paper's significance and despite all the debates this paper has generated, there has not been a replication attempt of its experiments. We collected data from four different sources (two on-line and two in-person) to replicate the experiments. Despite several different data sets and in various cases larger sample sizes, we failed to detect significant differences between the above-mentioned groups. Our results suggest that epistemic intuitions are more uniform across ethnic and socioeconomic groups than Weinberg et al. (2001) indicates. Given our data, we believe that the notion of differences in epistemic intuitions among different ethnic and socioeconomic groups advanced by Weinberg et al.

The contextualist theories of Cohen, Lewis, and DeRose explain this variation in terms of semantic hypotheses: 'S knows p' is indexical in meaning, referring to features of the ascriber's context like salience, interests, and stakes. The linguistic evidence against contextualism is extensive. I maintain that the contextual variation of knowledge claims results from pragmatic factors. One is variable strictness (Davis, Philos Stud, 132(3):395-438, 2007). In addition to its strict use, 'S knows p' may be used loosely to implicate that S is close enough to knowing p for contextually indicated purposes. Here I explore another variable: belief about what is known. This factor is pragmatic rather than semantic in that it affects the use of 'S knows p' without affecting its truth conditions. While variation in strictness accounts for the variation in the bank, parking, and some lottery cases, variation in belief accounts for the variation in other lottery cases and the epistemology cases. Along the way, I sketch an insensitive invariantist semantics that is strict but non-skeptical, and show how it works with these pragmatic factors.","Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Georgetown University,"Davis, WA (corresponding author), Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",davisw@georgetown.edu,,,,,,,87,13,13,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0031-8116,1573-0883,,PHILOS STUD,Philos.

It comes to the conclusion that doing history of philosophy is a way to think outside the box of the current philosophical orthodoxies. Somewhat paradoxically, far from imprisoning its students in outdated and crystallized views, the history of philosophy trains the mind to think differently and alternatively about the fundamental problems of philosophy. It keeps us alert to the fact that latest is not always best, and that a genuinely new perspective often means embracing and developing an old insight. The upshot is that the study of the history of philosophy has an innovative and subversive potential, and that philosophy has a great deal to gain from a long, broad, and deep conversation with its history.","Kings Coll London, London WC2R 2LS, England",University of London; King's College London,"Antognazza, MR (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, London WC2R 2LS, England.",,,"Antognazza, Maria Rosa/0000-0002-5214-479X",,,,,78,31,32,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0960-8788,1469-3526,,BRIT J HIST PHILOS,Brit.

Memory, according to the received view', is any state or process that results from the sequential stages of encoding, storage, and retrieval. By these criteria, memory, or its footprint, can be seen in virtually every mental state we are capable of having. This, I argue, stretches the term to the breaking point. I draw on phenomenological, historical, and conceptual considerations to make the case that an act of memory entails a direct, non-inferential feeling of reacquaintance with one's past. It does so by linking content retrieved from storage with autonoetic awareness during retrieval. On this view, memory is not the content of experience, but the manner in which that content is experienced. I discuss some theoretical and practical implications and advantages of adopting this more circumscribed view of memory.

In this paper, I focus on the main points of the argument. First, I discuss the conceivability of zombies. I briefly outline three other thought-experiments in order to determine what is expected of a good thought-experiment and its workings. Next, I turn to Chalmers' defense of their conceivability, where the key consideration is to present conceivability as a credible a priori method that can entail metaphysical possibility. I conclude that Chalmers does not manage to create a credible link between conceivability and possibility, thus failing to show that zombies are not only conceptually possible, but also metaphysically possible. The most problematic idea is the identification of logically possible worlds with metaphysically possible worlds. Chalmers' main aim is to defend conceivability as an a priori method of acquiring modal knowledge, but by limiting it to the rational domain, the acquired knowledge is not knowledge of the objective reality, but of the content of our thoughts.","[Malec, Maja] Univ Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Malec, M (corresponding author), Univ Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",malecmaja@yahoo.com,,,,,,,16,2,2,0,2,ACAD PUBL HOUSE,SOFIA,"1113 ACAD G BONCHEV ST, SOFIA, 6, BULGARIA",1313-888X,2367-5438,,BALK J PHILOS,Balk.

The argument eliminates one of the last plausible explanation of Gettier cases, and so of knowledge, in terms of non-factive mental states and non-mental conditions. I then I develop and defend a different kind of virtue epistemology, on which knowledge is an exercise of a competence to know. I show how the account, while circular, is not viciously so. It explains both how knowledge is a mental state, as well as the relationship between knowledge and justification, including justified false beliefs and Gettier cases. Moreover, although direct virtue epistemology is compatible with many views on the nature of belief, it can explain how knowledge might be metaphysically more fundamental than belief as well.","Rutgers State Univ, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Miracchi, L (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA.",miracchi@gmail.com,,,,,,,55,73,83,4,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0031-8116,1573-0883,,PHILOS STUD,Philos.

Instead, the method of counterexamples allows for the derivation of a disjunction, i.e., 'either the theory is false or an auxiliary assumption is false', not a negation of the target theory. This is so because, whenever the method of counterexamples is used in an attempt to refute a philosophical theory, there is a crucial auxiliary assumption that needs to be taken into account. The auxiliary assumption is that making intuitive judgments in response to hypothetical cases about the subject matter in question (e.g., knowledge or proper names) is a good method for finding out truths about that subject matter. Without good reasons to think that this assumption is warranted, the negation of a philosophical theory whose content is alleged to be in conflict with the content of an intuition cannot be justifiably derived using an argument that employs the method of counterexamples.","[Mizrahi, Moti] Florida Inst Technol, Sch Arts & Commun, 150 W Univ Blvd, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA",Florida Institute of Technology,"Mizrahi, M (corresponding author), Florida Inst Technol, Sch Arts & Commun, 150 W Univ Blvd, Melbourne, FL 32901 USA.",motimizra@gmail.com,,"Mizrahi, Moti/0000-0002-2160-5717",,,,,58,4,4,0,0,KRK EDICIONES,OVIEDO,"ALVAREZ LORENZANA, 27, OVIEDO, 33006, SPAIN",0210-1602,,,TEOREMA,Teorema,,2015,34,3,,,,,141,158,,,,,,18,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,V47EU,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000209935900008,View Full Record in Web of Science

This article argues that New Testament scholars have perhaps too quickly and uncritically adopted this method, when it is out of step with contemporary analytic epistemology. The method Wright employs-and which many have adopted-originates with an internalist epistemic account developed in the 1940s. Since then, key developments in the study of epistemology (beginning with Gettier in 1963) have made Wright's critical realist model irrelevant in many ways. In light of these inadequacies, we tentatively outline some potential components of a more promising historical epistemology for the study of Christian origins.","[Porter, Stanley E.] McMaster Divin Coll, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Pitts, Andrew W.] Arizona Christian Univ, Phoenix, AZ USA",McMaster University,"Porter, SE (corresponding author), McMaster Divin Coll, Hamilton, ON, Canada.",porters@mcmaster.ca; andrew.pitts@arizonachristian.edu,,,,,,,75,8,8,0,1,BRILL,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",1476-8690,1745-5197,,J STUD HIST JESUS,J.

The purpose of this paper is to develop insight with the potential to inform future education and professional development programmes. Design/methodology/approach - The conceptual framework for the study is set via discussion of the historical approach, internal communication, professionalization, and knowledge. The historical critical analysis research methodology is used to study data sources including professional body reports and archival documentation. Deductive and inductive coding is combined with template analysis to ensure rigorous qualitative data analysis. Findings - The study finds inconsistent treatment of the internal communication discipline in public relations education frameworks over time. Distinct inclusion was found in early frameworks, clear recognition of the growing importance of internal communication was evident in later guidelines, but the study discovers that the discipline has been excluded from recent frameworks. Research limitations/implications - While the study draws on relevant data sources credited with international influence, it is limited to sources published in English. Practical implications - Practical educational and methodological implications of the research are discussed along with avenues for further research including surveys or qualitative research to investigate contemporary views held by practitioners and educators on internal communication curricula. Social implications - Social and management implications are discussed including a call for the reinstatement of internal communication in globally influential public relations education frameworks. Originality/value - The discipline of internal communication is still understudied which is surprising given its impact on organisational effectiveness. Furthermore, little previous attention has been paid to the history of internal communication education. This paper tackles that void, finds inconsistent treatment of the discipline in education frameworks over time, and contributes discussion on why these inconsistencies have occurred.","[Welch, Mary] Univ Cent Lancashire, Lancashire Business Sch, Commun Management, Preston, Lancs, England",University of Central Lancashire,"Welch, M (corresponding author), Univ Cent Lancashire, Lancashire Business Sch, Commun Management, Preston, Lancs, England.",mwelch@uclan.ac.uk,,"Welch, Mary/0000-0001-6252-6049",,,,,60,6,8,1,10,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1363-254X,1478-0852,,J COMMUN MANAG,J.

It presents various frameworks of trust, and argues that the ethical framework of trust is what constitutes our responsibility to reveal desired norms and standards and embed them in other frameworks of trust. The first section briefly presents the IoT and scrutinizes the scarce philosophical work that has been done on this subject so far. The second section suggests that the field of epistemology is not sufficiently capable of dealing with technologies, and presents a possible solution to this problem. It is argued that knowledge is not only social phenomena, but also a technological one, and that in order to address epistemological issues in technology, we need to carefully depart from traditional epistemic analysis and form a new approach that is technological (termed here Techno-Epistemology). The third and fourth sections engage in an epistemic analysis of trust by dividing it in to various frameworks. The last section argues that these various frameworks of trust can be understood to form a trustworthy large-scale socio-technological system, emphasizing the place of ethical trust as constituting our commitment to give proper accounts for all of the other frameworks.","[Freiman, Ori] Bar Ilan Univ, Grad Program Sci Technol & Soc, Ramat Gan, Israel",Bar Ilan University,"Freiman, O (corresponding author), Bar Ilan Univ, Grad Program Sci Technol & Soc, Ramat Gan, Israel.",freimano@post.bgu.ac.il,"Freiman, Ori/G-7140-2017","Freiman, Ori/0000-0002-6750-9130",,,,,72,5,5,0,0,INT CENTER INFORMATION ETHICS,KARLSRUHE,"C/O RAFEL CAPURRO, EIC, REDTENBACHERSTR 9, KARLSRUHE, 76133, GERMANY",1614-1687,,,INT REV INF ETHICS,Int.

The challenge virtue epistemology faces is to explain the intuitive lack of knowledge in Fake Barn cases, whilst holding on to the core claim that knowledge is success from ability. Ernest Sosa's version of virtue epistemology promises to rise to this challenge. Sosa distinguishes two types of knowledge, animal knowledge and reflective knowledge. He argues that while animal knowledge is present in Fake Barn cases, reflective knowledge is absent and ventures to explain the intuition of ignorance by the absence of reflective knowledge. This paper argues that Sosa's treatment of Fake Barn cases fails as it commits Sosa to a number of highly counterintuitive results elsewhere in epistemology.",,,"Kelp, C (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.",christoph.kelp@hiw.kuleuven.be,"Kelp, Christoph/AGK-3359-2022","Kelp, Christoph/0000-0001-7735-2109",,,,,17,1,1,0,0,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1742-3600,1750-0117,,EPISTEME-J INDIV SOC,Episteme,DEC,2014,11,4,,,,,411,422,,10.1017/epi.2014.21,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/epi.2014.21,,,12,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,AT4XZ,,Green Accepted,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000344947000003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The alterations are as obviously irrelevant as the victims' skin colour, and consistently treating them as relevant would have unacceptable implications for choices between more and less harmful ways of securing greater goods. This shows not only how the principles philosophers have proposed for distinguishing between these cases cannot withstand scrutiny, but how we can be sure that there are no relevant differences yet to be discovered.

People living in highly industrialized countries share a way of life that comes with high levels of emissions. Their expectations to be able to continue their projects imply their holding expectations to similarly high future levels of personal emissions. We argue that the frustration or undermining of these expectations would cause them significant harm. Further, the article investigates under what conditions people can be thought to hold legitimate expectations, in particular about permissible levels of future emissions. We distinguish differing theories of understanding these conditions, namely authority-based and justice-based theories, that each allows us to systematically distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate expectations. Furthermore, with respect to individuals' future permissible emissions we give several reasons for holding that such theories cannot identify a particular expectation to a specific level of personal emissions as the only legitimate one. Finally, we argue that the set of legitimate expectations that people hold with respect to a just and effective solution to climate change has normative significance in at least two ways: the differing but equally legitimate expectations ought to be taken into account when justifying what could count as such a solution and when determining the just way of arriving at and implementing such a solution.","[Meyer, Lukas H.] Graz Univ, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Meyer, Lukas H.; Sanklecha, Pranay] Graz Univ, Dept Philosophy, A-8010 Graz, Austria",University of Graz; University of Graz,"Meyer, LH (corresponding author), Graz Univ, Dept Philosophy, Attemsgasse 25-2, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",lukas.meyer@uni-graz.at; pranay.sanklecha@uni-graz.at,"Meyer, Lukas/L-3740-2016","Meyer, Lukas/0000-0001-5845-6084",,,,,38,33,34,0,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1470-594X,1741-3060,,POLIT PHILOS ECON,Polit.

Once probabilities on the agent's evidence are introduced into epistemic logic in a very natural way, it is easy to construct models of improbable knowing, some of which have realistic interpretations, for instance concerning agents like us with limited powers of perceptual discrimination. Improbable knowing is an extreme case of failure of the KK principle, that is, of a case of knowing something even though one does not know at the time that one knows that thing. A generalization of the argument yields cases of improbable rationality, in which it is rational for one to do something even though it is almost certain on one's evidence at the time that it is not rational for one to do that thing. When the models are elaborated to represent appearances and beliefs as well as knowledge, they turn out to contain Gettier cases. Neglect of the possibility of improbable knowing may cause some sceptical claims and claims of the non-closure of knowledge under competent deduction to look more plausible than they deserve to.

A common reply to these findings is the 'expertise defense' - the claim that although biases may be found in the intuitions of non-philosophers, persons with expertise in philosophy will be resistant to these biases. Much debate over the expertise defense has centered over the question of the burden of proof; must defenders of expertise provide empirical evidence of its existence, or should we grant the existence of philosophical expertise as a 'default' assumption? Defenders have frequently appealed to analogy with other fields; since expertise clearly exists in, e.g., the sciences, we are entitled to assume its existence in philosophy. Recently, however, experimentalists have begun to provide empirical evidence that biases in intuition extend even to philosophers. Though these findings don't yet suffice to defeat the default assumption of expertise the analogy argument motivates, they do force any proponent of the analogy argument to provide more specific and empirically informed proposals for the possible nature of philosophical expertise.","[Nado, Jennifer] Lingnan Univ, Philosophy, Tuen Mun, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Lingnan University,"Nado, J (corresponding author), Lingnan Univ, Dept Philosophy, Tuen Mun, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",jennifernado@gmail.com,,"Nado, Jennifer/0000-0003-1680-2975",,,,,67,48,52,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,1747-9991,,PHILOS COMPASS,Philos.

So, it is not surprising that we are beginning to see it put to work in other areas of philosophy. Recently, several philosophers have proposed that truthmaker theory is the key to solving the Gettier problem. Edmund Gettier demonstrated that the traditional analysis of knowledge (as justified, true belief) was unsatisfactory. The truthmaker solution proposes that knowledge is a justified, true belief, where the source of one's justification is either identical to, or else causally related to, the state of affairs which makes the believed proposition true. This amendment of the traditional analysis of knowledge purportedly escapes the problems identified by Gettier cases.

Experimental philosophy is an emerging discipline that examines the cognitive nature of such intuitive judgments. In this paper, we assess the methodological and epistemological status of experimental philosophy. We focus on the Knobe effect, in which our intuitive judgment of the intentionality of an action seems to depend on the perceived moral status of that action. The debate on the philosophical implications of the Knobe effect has been framed in terms of the distinction between the competence and performance of the concept of intentionality. Some scholars seem to suggest that the Knobe effect reflects the competence (or otherwise, the performance error) of the concept of intentionality. However, we argue that these notions are purely functional and thus do not have philosophical implications, without assuming normativism, which we see as problematic in a psychological methodology.

In particular, it cannot account for philosophers' treatment of a priori intuitions, for nonpropositional uses of intuition, and for philosophers' failure to use intuition to exclude the counterintuitive.

I argue that this kind of power attribution should inform discussions of Frankfurt's counterexample strategy, in that an alternative possibility should not be considered robust unless it's up to the agent whether or not it's realized. I argue, as well, that understanding robust alternatives in this way sheds light on the relationship between the Frankfurt literature and the Luck Objection to libertarianism.","Univ Delaware, Dept Philosophy, Newark, DE 19716 USA",University of Delaware,"Shabo, S (corresponding author), Univ Delaware, Dept Philosophy, 24 Kent Way, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",sshabo@udel.edu,,,,,,,43,9,9,0,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0031-8116,1573-0883,,PHILOS STUD,Philos.

Fiduciary obligations differ from promissory obligations with respect to the possibility of accidental compliance. Promissory obligations can be satisfied through behavior that conforms to a promise, even if that behavior is done for inappropriate reasons. By contrast, fiduciary loyalty necessarily has an intentional dimension, one that prevents satisfaction through accidental compliance. The intentional dimension of fiduciary loyalty is best described by what we call the shaping account. This account both explains the conscientiousness that loyalty demands and improves on other accounts of the intentional dimension of loyalty. Our analysis challenges two of the most prominent ways of conceptualizing fiduciary obligations. Contractarianism configures fiduciary obligations as a species of contractual duties. The view that we call proscriptivism reduces fiduciary obligations to the juridical prohibitions that apply to fiduciaries. Neither of these approaches is satisfactory, because each neglects the intentional dimension of fiduciary loyalty.","[Galoob, Stephen R.] Univ Tulsa, Coll Law, Tulsa, OK 74104 USA; [Leib, Ethan J.] Fordham Law Sch, New York, NY 10023 USA",University of Tulsa; Fordham University,"Galoob, SR (corresponding author), Univ Tulsa, Coll Law, Tulsa, OK 74104 USA.",,,,,,,,68,17,19,1,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1352-3252,1469-8048,,LEG THEOR,Leg.

Some accounts of how experiences provide justification emphasize the role of the experiences' distinctive phenomenology, i.e. 'what it is like' to have the experience. Other accounts emphasize the justificatory role to the experiences' etiology. A number of authors have used cases of cognitively penetrated visual experience to raise an epistemic challenge for theories of perceptual justification that emphasize the justificatory role of phenomenology rather than etiology. Proponents of the challenge argue that cognitively penetrated visual experiences can fail to provide the usual justification because they have improper etiologies. However, extant arguments for the challenge's key claims are subject to formidable objections. In this paper, I present the challenge's key claims, raise objections to previous attempts to establish them, and then offer a novel argument in support of the challenge. My argument relies on an analogy between cognitively penetrated visual and emotional experiences. I argue that some emotional experiences fail to provide the relevant justification because of their improper etiologies and conclude that analogous cognitively penetrated visual experiences fail to provide the relevant justification because of their etiologies, as well.","No Arizona Univ, Dept Philosophy, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA",Northern Arizona University,"Vance, J (corresponding author), No Arizona Univ, Dept Philosophy, Box 6011, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",jona.vance@nau.edu,,,,,,,65,22,24,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0031-8116,1573-0883,,PHILOS STUD,Philos.

However, the concern for building or discovering strong philosophical underpinnings of SD, undoubtedly playing an important role in the modeling process, is a long-standing issue, in a way that there is a considerable debate about the assumptions or the philosophical foundations of it. In this paper, with a new perspective, we have explored theory of knowledge in SD models and found strange similarities between classic epistemological concepts such as justification and truth, and the mechanism of obtaining knowledge in SD models. In this regard, we have discussed related theories of epistemology and based on this analysis, have suggested some implications for moderating common problems in the modeling process of SD.

In contrast to theories that focus on individuals as actors, the systemic-constructivist approach emphasizes the relevance of social systems and regards the construction of knowledge as a self-referential process that takes place in social systems. We propose that it is the system that defines what is accepted as legitimate knowledge and thus shapes individuals' behavior. We present this approach and its implications by providing a case study of knowledge construction in Wikipedia. We analyzed the article about the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant shortly after the nuclear catastrophe unfolded. There was a flood of highly uncertain information circulating, which the social system Wikipedia had to deal with and make meaning of. We obtained a group of very diverse people who largely lacked specific background education on the topic but accomplished the collaborative creation of an article that was later considered by experts to be of high quality. By interpreting these occurrences as operations of a social system, we aim to extend the theoretical basis of the learning sciences with an approach that emphasizes systems and their structures instead of individuals or groups.

However, the development of systematic theory has been hampered by the difficulty of adequately specifying foundational assumptions. We address this problem by defining a concept of collective performance, which brings together a range of recurring organizational action patterns that have been studied under labels such as routine, practice, standard operating procedure, or genre of action. All these forms of organizational action are based on human habit to a significant degree. We propose a conceptual framework for such habit-based organizational action patterns. The framework is a set of core principles and desirable model properties that can serve as a guide in the development of formal models of collective performance. It provides micro-foundations for the modeling of collective performance that are aligned with contemporary developments in psychology.

In The Myth of Knowledge Laurence BonJour argues that we should reject fallibilism for two main reasons: first, there is no adequate way to specify what level of justification is required for fallible knowledge; second, we cannot explain why any level of justification that is less than fully conclusive should have the significance that makes knowledge valuable. I will reply to these challenges in a way that allows me to make progress on a number of important issues in contemporary epistemology: epistemic value, the functional roles of knowledge attributions, experimental epistemology, skepticism, the Gettier problem, and the lottery paradox. My argument is motivated by appealing to various insights derived from the method of 'practical explication', particularly the idea that a central purpose of the concept of knowledge is to flag reliable informants. My conclusion is that various practical and theoretical considerations derived from the method of practical explication support the fallibilist conception of knowledge.","Univ Cambridge, Fac Philosophy, Cambridge CB2 1ST, England",University of Cambridge,"Hannon, M (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Fac Philosophy, Cambridge CB2 1ST, England.",mhannon09@gmail.com,,"Hannon, Michael/0000-0003-2342-8555",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"For helpful advice I am grateful to Hallvard Lillehammer, Chris Cowie, Robin McKenna, Nick Hughes, and the participants of a 2013 Cambridge philosophy seminar.

In light of lessons from their failure, I provide a new and successful counterexample to the safety condition on knowledge. It follows, then, that knowledge need not be safe. Safety at a time depends counterfactually on what would likely happen at that time or soon after in a way that knowledge does not.

I motivate the specific form of Rationalism shared by, among others, White (Philos Stud 131:525-557, 2006) and Wright (Proc Aristot Soc Suppl Vol 78:167-212, 2004), which credits us with warrant to believe (or accept, in Wright's terms) that our senses are reliably veridical, where that warrant is one we enjoy by default, that is, without relying on any evidence or engaging in any positive argument. The problem with this form of Rationalism is that, even if you have default knowledge that your senses are reliable, this is not adequate to rule out every kind of skeptical scenario. The problem is created by one-off skeptical scenarios, scenarios that involve a highly reliable perceiver who, by a pure fluke, has a one-off, non-veridical experience. I claim you cannot infer that your present perceptual experience is veridical just on the basis of knowledge of your general reliability. More generally, if you infer that the present F is G, just on the basis of your knowledge that most Fs are Gs, this is what I call statistical inference, and, as I argue, statistical inference by itself does not generate knowledge. I defend this view of statistical inference against objections, including the objection that radical skepticism about our ordinary inductive knowledge will follow unless statistical inference generates knowledge.","Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Dogramaci, S (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",sinan.dogramaci@gmail.com,,,,,,,44,2,2,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0031-8116,1573-0883,,PHILOS STUD,Philos.

The problem stems from the clash between the desire to model rational agents, which should be capable of simple logical inferences, and the fact that any logical inference, however complex, almost inevitably consists of inference steps that are simple enough. This contradiction points to the fruitlessness of trying to solve the Logical Omniscience Problem qualitatively if the rationality of agents is to be maintained. We provide a quantitative solution to the problem compatible with the two important facets of the reasoning agent: rationality and resource boundedness. More precisely, we provide a test for the logical omniscience problem in a given formal theory of knowledge. The quantitative measures we use are inspired by the complexity theory. We illustrate our framework with a number of examples ranging from the traditional implicit representation of knowledge in modal logic to the language of justification logic, which is capable of spelling out the internal inference process. We use these examples to divide representations of knowledge into logically omniscient and not logically omniscient, thus trying to determine how much information about the reasoning process needs to be present in a theory to avoid logical omniscience.

The paradox shows that any theory extending Robinson arithmetic with a predicate K(x) satisfying the factivity axiom K((A) over bar) -> A as well as a few other epistemically plausible principles is inconsistent. After surveying the background of the paradox, we will focus on a recent debate about the role of epistemic closure principles in the Knower. We will suggest this debate sheds new light on the concept of knowledge which is at issue in the paradox i.e. is it a thin notion divorced from concepts such as evidence or justification, or is it a thick notion more closely resembling mathematical provability? We will argue that a number of features of the paradox suggest that the latter option is more plausible. Along the way, we will provide a reconstruction of the paradox using a quantified extension of Artemov's (2001) [2] Logic of Proofs, as well as a series of results linking the original formulation of the paradox to reflection principles for formal arithmetic. On this basis, we will argue that while the Knower can be understood to motivate a distinction between levels of knowledge, it does not provide a rationale for recognizing a uniform hierarchy of knowledge predicates in the manner suggested by Anderson (1984) [1].

What becomes of the meaning of epistemology once the ontological status of knowledge is taken seriously, and its political dimensions impossible to ignore? If the knower is no longer an impersonaL universal subject, but always a situated and purposeful actor, what kind of epistemology do we need, and what social functions can we expect it to play? Sociological reflexivity embraces the historicity and situatedness of knowledge understood as a cultural product and a social practice. It therefore enables us to cope with the collapse of our absolute and universal epistemic foundations and frames of reference, and to redefine the existential and practical meanings of knowledge for social life. In so doing, it also gives political meaning to epistemology itself, understood as a sociological theory of knowledge, not a normative one. Reflexivity can be envisaged as both a bending back and a bending forward of knowledge as praxis. As a bending back of knowledge on itself, it entails a rigorous understanding of the social conditions of possibility of our thought and our values, and hence a critical assessment of what our world-views and notions of truth owe to the social order in which we are inscribed. As a bending forward, it turns this objective understanding into an instrument of existential and social emancipation, by delineating the structural spaces of freedom and agency that allow for a meaningful and responsible scholarly practice.","[Hamati-Ataya, Inanna] Aberystwyth Univ, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales",Aberystwyth University,"Hamati-Ataya, I (corresponding author), Aberystwyth Univ, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales.",,,"Hamati-Ataya, Inanna/0000-0003-3735-8834",,,,,24,4,4,0,0,RUSSIAN ACAD SCIENCES-INST PHILOSOPHY,MOSCOW,"UL VOLHONKA, DOM 14-1, STR 5, MOSCOW, 119991, RUSSIA",1811-833X,2311-7133,,EPISTEMOL PHILOS SCI,Epistemol.

Epistemological and ontological aspects of knowledge have been examined. SC networks provide a more generic setting for managing knowledge due to the additional issues concerning flow of knowledge across the boundaries of organizations. Design/methodology/approach - Morphological analysis has been used to build the knowledge classification model. Morphological approach is particularly useful in exploratory research on concepts/entities having multiple dimensions. Knowledge itself has been shown in literature to have many characteristics, and the methodology used has enabled a comprehensive classification scheme based on such characteristics. Findings - A single comprehensive classification model for knowledge that exists in SC networks has been proposed. Nine characteristics, each possessing two or more value options, have been finally included in the model. Research limitations/implications - Knowledge characteristics have been mostly derived from past research with the exception of three which have been introduced without empirical evidence. Although the article is primarily about SC knowledge, the results are fairly generic. Practical implications - The proposed model would be of use in developing KM policies, procedures and establishing knowledge management systems in SC networks. The model will cater to both system and people aspects of a KMF. Originality/value - The proposed knowledge classification model based on morphological analysis fills a gap in a vital area of research in KM as well as SC management. No similar classification model of knowledge with all its dimensions has been found in literature.","[Sudhindra, S.] Christ Univ, Inst Management, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Ganesh, L.

This paper defends the 'Property Thesis', the position that kinds of being (and their structures) are properties of the entities that have them. I give two arguments for this thesis. The first is grounded in the fact that Heidegger refers to kinds and structures of being as 'characteristics' and 'determinations', which are just two different words for 'properties', in the broadest senses of these terms. The second argument is based on the fact that kinds and structures of being play three roles that properties are supposed to play: they account for similarities between things, they are what predicates express, and they are what abstract nouns refer to.","St Anselm Coll, Manchester, NH 03102 USA",,"Tepley, J (corresponding author), St Anselm Coll, Manchester, NH 03102 USA.",,,,,,,,20,3,6,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0967-2559,1466-4542,,INT J PHILOS STUD,Int.

A consequence of this thesis is that there is a type of knowledge that requires belief and a type that does not. A familiar example strikingly similar to the sort of example used to introduce the propositional/doxastic justification makes a prima facie case. Additional theoretical advantages are revealed when the distinction is applied within the context of some recent epistemological debates. These include debates over the knowledge account of assertion, testimonial knowledge, self-deception, and the question of whether knowledge can be essentially based on falsehood. It is contended that the sort of distinction offered here provides a way to settle these debates and, at the same time, acknowledge what is correct in the opposing positions.","E Carolina Univ, Dept Philosophy, Greenville, NC 27858 USA",University of North Carolina; East Carolina University,"Veber, M (corresponding author), E Carolina Univ, Dept Philosophy, Greenville, NC 27858 USA.",veberm@ecu.edu,,,,,,,20,4,4,0,3,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1068,1467-9973,,METAPHILOSOPHY,Metaphilosophy,JAN,2014,45,1,,,,,120,132,,10.1111/meta.12055,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/meta.12055,,,13,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,287MW,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000329546900007,View Full Record in Web of Science

This banal observation appears to favour empiricism, especially in philosophy of science, though no rationalist ever denied their importance. Natural sciences often provide what appear to be, and are taken by scientists as, realist, causal explanations of natural phenomena, often in terms of forces or entities we do not perceive with our normal, unaided human senses. Empiricism has never been congenial to realism about such scientific posits. Bas van Fraassen's Constructive Empiricism purports that realist interpretations of any un-observables mentioned by a scientific theory in principle always transcend whatever can be justified by that theory's empirical adequacy, and that explanations are merely pragmatic, insofar as they are context-specific to the presuppositions of whomever poses the question an explanation is to answer. Here I argue that Constructive Empiricism rests upon a series of flawed presumptions about natural science and about epistemology. I draw upon two main resources. One resource is the constraints upon specifically cognitive reference to particulars, first identified by Kant (and later by Evans). The second is William Harper's (2011) brilliant re-analysis and defense of Newton's Principia, which shows that, and how, Newton justified his realism about gravitational force. One surprise is that Kant's semantics of singular cognitive reference (examined in 3) directly and strongly supports Newton's Rule 4 of scientific method (4), which strongly supports his realism about gravitational force (summarized in 2). A further surprise is that Hegel first recognized that this semantics of singular cognitive reference directly and strongly supports Newton's methodological Rule 4 of experimental philosophy in ways which support Newton's realism about gravitational force, and about distance forces generally. The textual and exegetical issues these attributions require I examine elsewhere. Here I make these important findings available to philosophers and historians of science.",,,,,"Westphal, Kenneth R./AAN-3834-2020","Westphal, Kenneth R./0000-0001-6039-760X",,,,,155,11,11,0,1,EDIZIONI ETS,PISA,"Lungarno Mediceo 16, 56127 PISA, ITALY",2281-8618,2282-0248,,PHILOS INQ,Philos.

As these primitives are the most basic axioms of information systems research, it is somewhat surprising that consensus on exact definitions seems to be lacking. This paper presents a theoretical and empirical exploration of the sometimes directly quoted, and often implied Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy and its quality dimension. We first review relevant literature from a range of perspectives and develop and contextualise a theoretical DIKW framework through semiotics. The literature review identifies definitional commonalities and divergences from a scholarly perspective; the theoretical discussion contextualises the terms and their relationships within a semiotic framework and proposes relevant definitions grounded in that framework. Next, rooted in Wittgenstein's ordinary language philosophy, we analyse 20 online news articles for their uses of the terms and present the results of an online focus group discussion comprising 16 information systems experts. The empirical exploration identifies a range of definitional ambiguities from a practical perspective.","[Baskarada, Sasa; Koronios, Andy] Univ South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia",University of South Australia,"Baskarada, S (corresponding author), Univ South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",baskarada@gmail.com; andy.koronios@unisa.edu.au,"Paniagua, Enrique/H-3536-2015; Koronios, Andy/F-4107-2013",,,,,,126,24,25,0,6,"UNIV CANBERRA, FAC INFORMATION SCIENCES & ENGINEERING",BRUCE,"BLDG 11, KIRINARI ST, BRUCE, ACT 2617, AUSTRALIA",1449-8618,1326-2238,,AUSTRALAS J INF SYST,Australas.

In line with Wittgenstein's later views on language and philosophy and their corresponding functions, this paper provides a general diagnosis of the problem: similarities in syntax do not entail similarities in meaning. By employing Wittgenstein's metaphors (i.e., handles and tools) and an analysis via concrete cases and analogies, this paper responds to the challenge presented by the Scope Problem not by providing a satisfactory definition of truth but rather, by providing its dissolution a la Wittgenstein.","Univ Philippines, Dept Humanities, Los Banos, Philippines",University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Los Banos; University of the Philippines Open University,"Boongaling, JI (corresponding author), Univ Philippines, Dept Humanities, Los Banos, Philippines.",,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,2,PHILIPPINE NATL PHILOSOPHICAL RES SOC,QUEZON CITY,"25 CAPITOL HOMESITE SUBD, 99 TANDANG SORA AVE, QUEZON CITY, 1116, PHILIPPINES",2244-1875,2244-1883,,PHILOS-INT J PHILOS,Philos.-Int.

I show here that the defense of Grice's Razor found in these Gricean invariantists, and its use against epistemic contextualism, display all the problems pointed out earlier in Davis (1998). The everyday variation in acceptable knowledge claims is better explained in terms of implicature than indexicality, but general conversational principles shed little light on whether 'know' is used hyperbolically, meiotically, or loosely in a context, although this issue is crucial in deciding what if anything 'S knows p' implicates. I present reasons favoring an account of the representative bank case in terms of loose use, making clear how they differ from Grice's Razor.","Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Georgetown University,"Davis, WA (corresponding author), Georgetown Univ, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",,,,,,,,59,7,7,0,4,PHILOSOPHY DOCUMENTATION CENTER,CHARLOTTESVILLE,"PO BOX 7147, CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA 22906-7147 USA",1053-8364,2153-7984,,J PHILOS RES,J.

In the case of biology, this question is quite pressing, since according to many specialists we do not find genuine universal explanatory laws in biology, and yet, biologists constantly use models as explanatory devices. It is probably not possible to reduce all of the ways in which models explain to one unifying pattern. If there is a common trait in all of these different ways it is perhaps that they achieve a better understanding of phenomena. It is argued in this paper that the notion of understanding is not irremediably subjective.

This idea is often justified by appealing to knowledge ascriptions and related linguistic phenomena; i.e., an utterance of the form 'S knows that p, but not-p' sounds contradictory. In a recent article, Allan Hazlett argues that our ordinary concept of knowledge is not factive. From this it seems to follow that epistemologists cannot appeal to ordinary language to justify the truth condition of knowledge. More significantly, Hazlett claims that epistemologists theorizing about knowledge should not concern themselves with the ordinary concept of knowledge as revealed by knowledge ascriptions and related linguistic phenomena. My paper has two goals: first, to defend the orthodox view that the ordinary concept of knowledge is factive; second, to undermine Hazlett's claim that epistemologists should not theorize about knowledge on the basis of how 'knows' is used in everyday speech.","Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",University of Cambridge,"Hannon, M (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",,,"Hannon, Michael/0000-0003-2342-8555",,,,,33,9,10,0,2,PHILOSOPHY DOCUMENTATION CENTER,CHARLOTTESVILLE,"PO BOX 7147, CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA 22906-7147 USA",1053-8364,2153-7984,,J PHILOS RES,J.

It argues that claims to reason, truth and knowledge can never escape the impact of individual perspective, community standards and power relations. At the same time, however, it rejects the realist assertion that subjectivism and relativism are oxymoronic or self-defeating positions. Instead, it is argued that epistemological scepticism is a healthy political position to adopt in that it guards against the complacent acceptance of seemingly authoritative assertions of reason, truth and knowledge.","[Nicolson, Donald] Univ Strathclyde, Law, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",University of Strathclyde,"Nicolson, D (corresponding author), Univ Strathclyde, Law, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",donald.nicolson@strath.ac.uk,,,,,,,151,6,8,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1365-7127,1740-5572,,INT J EVID PROOF,Word-J.

Contemporary philosophical work on the nature of this difference has focused on scenarios known as Gettier cases. Designed as counterexamples to the classical theory that knowledge is justified true belief, these cases feature agents who arrive at true beliefs in ways which seem reasonable or justified, while nevertheless seeming to lack knowledge. Prior empirical investigation of these cases has raised questions about whether lay people generally share philosophers' intuitions about these cases, or whether lay intuitions vary depending on individual factors (e.g. ethnicity) or factors related to specific types of Gettier cases (e.g. cases that include apparent evidence). We report an experiment on lay attributions of knowledge and justification for a wide range of Gettier Cases and for a related class of controversial cases known as Skeptical Pressure cases, which are also thought by philosophers to elicit intuitive denials of knowledge. Although participants rated true beliefs in Gettier and Skeptical Pressure cases as being justified, they were significantly less likely to attribute knowledge for these cases than for matched True Belief cases. This pattern of response was consistent across different variations of Gettier cases and did not vary by ethnicity or gender, although attributions of justification were found to be positively related to measures of empathy. These findings therefore suggest that across demographic groups, laypeople share similar epistemic concepts with philosophers, recognizing a difference between knowledge and justified true belief.

I argue that, if Sosa's account of knowledge as apt belief is correct, this means that acting for a normative reason is in many respects similar to knowledge. In order to strengthen Sosa's account of knowledge, I propose to supplement it with an appeal to sub-competences. This clarifies how this account can deal with certain Gettier cases, and it helps to understand how exactly acting for a normative reason is similar to apt belief.","Univ Saarland, Philosoph Inst, D-66123 Saarbrucken, Germany",Saarland University,"Mantel, S (corresponding author), Univ Saarland, Philosoph Inst, Geb C5-2,R218-1, D-66123 Saarbrucken, Germany.",Sum82@web.de,,,,,,,32,13,13,0,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0039-7857,1573-0964,,SYNTHESE,Synthese,NOV,2013,190,17,,,,,3865,3888,,10.1007/s11229-012-0230-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11229-012-0230-8,,,24,History & Philosophy Of Science; Philosophy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),History & Philosophy of Science; Philosophy,257PF,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000327396700010,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Smirnova, A",,,,"Smirnova, Anastasia",,,"Evidentiality in Bulgarian: Temporality, Epistemic Modality, and Information Source",JOURNAL OF SEMANTICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This article presents a formal semantic analysis of the Bulgarian evidential. The analysis is motivated by a number of facts that have gone unnoticed in the literature on evidentiality in Bulgarian and which cannot be explained by previous analyses (Izvorski 1997; Sauerland & Schenner 2007; Koev 2011). First, I show that the same evidential construction in Bulgarian can express direct, reportative and inferential information sources. These data challenge the current analysis of the Bulgarian evidential as indirect (Izvorski 1997), and show that in some languages a single evidential morpheme can express both direct and indirect information sources (contra Willett 1988; Aikhenvald 2004). Second, I show that the Bulgarian evidential expresses temporal meaning: it functions as a relative tense. Finally, while I retain the insights of Izvorski's modal analysis, I substantially change the modal component to account for reports of false information in reportative contexts (I analyze them as de dicto reports). Ultimately, I argue that the evidential construction in Bulgarian has a tripartite meaning: it encodes information source, temporality and epistemic modality. This article contributes to the understanding of the semantics of evidentials cross-linguistically (cf. Faller 2002; McCready & Ogata 2007; Matthewson et al. 2007) by showing how the interaction of the modal and the temporal component affects the distribution and meaning of evidentials in discourse.","Tufts Univ, Ctr Cognit Studies, Medford, MA 02155 USA",Tufts University,"Smirnova, A (corresponding author), Tufts Univ, Ctr Cognit Studies, 111 Miner Hall, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",Anastasia.Smirnova@tufts.edu,,,,,,,64,24,26,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0167-5133,1477-4593,,J SEMANT,J.

Paradigmatic examples of this argument begin with a counterfactual premise: had we been born at a different time or in a difference place, we easily could have held different beliefs on religious topics. Ultimately, and perhaps by additional steps, we're meant to reach the skeptical conclusion that very many of our religious beliefs do not amount to knowledge. I survey some historical examples of this argument, and I try to fill the gap between the counterfactual premise and the skeptical conclusion as forcefully as possible. I consider the following possibilities: there are no additional steps in the argument; or there are and they concern the alleged safety condition on knowledge, or the alleged non-accidentality condition on knowledge, or the unclarity produced by disagreement. On every possibility, the argument from the counterfactual premise to the conclusion of widespread skepticism is invalid.

Activities associated with knowledge production and use are called epistemic practices. Such practices are considered in biomedical and clinical literatures, social sciences of medicine, philosophy of science and philosophy of medicine, and also in other nonmedical literatures. A host of different kinds of knowledge claims have been identified, each with different uses and logics of justification. A general framework is needed to situate these diverse contributions in medical epistemology, so we can see how they fit together. But developing such a framework turns out to be quite tricky. In this survey, three possible frameworks are considered along with the difficulties associated with each of them. The essay concludes with a fourth framework, which considers any epistemology as part of a practice that is oriented toward overcoming errors that emerge in antecedently given practices where knowledge is developed and used. As medicine indirectly advances health by directly mitigating disease, so epistemology indirectly advances knowledge by directly mitigating error.","[Khushf, George] Univ S Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208 USA",University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"Khushf, G (corresponding author), Univ S Carolina, Dept Philosophy, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",khushf@sc.edu,,,,,,,59,15,20,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0360-5310,1744-5019,,J MED PHILOS,J.

Yet, as shown by familiar preface paradox and lottery-type cases, the possibility of aggregating uncertainty casts doubt on its tenability. We show that these considerations go much further than previously recognized and significantly restrict the kinds of closure ordinary theories of knowledge can endorse. Meeting the challenge of uncertainty aggregation requires either the restriction of knowledge-extending inferences to single premises, or eliminating epistemic uncertainty in known premises. The first strategy, while effective, retains little of the original idea-conclusions even of modus ponens inferences from known premises are not always known. We then look at the second strategy, inspecting the most elaborate and promising attempt to secure the epistemic role of basic inferences, namely Timothy Williamson's safety theory of knowledge. We argue that while it indeed has the merit of allowing basic inferences such as modus ponens to extend knowledge, Williamson's theory faces formidable difficulties. These difficulties, moreover, arise from the very feature responsible for its virtue- the infallibilism of knowledge.","[Sharon, Assaf] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Spectre, Levi] Open Univ Israel, Raanana, Israel",Stanford University; Open University Israel,"Spectre, L (corresponding author), Open Univ Israel, Raanana, Israel.",Assafsh@stanford.edu; Levi.spectre@gmail.com,"Spectre, Levi/AFK-0559-2022; Spectre, Levi/AAF-7533-2022","Spectre, Levi/0000-0002-2913-346X",,,,,21,11,12,0,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0039-7857,1573-0964,,SYNTHESE,Synthese,SEP,2013,190,14,,,,,2731,2748,,10.1007/s11229-012-0078-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11229-012-0078-y,,,18,History & Philosophy Of Science; Philosophy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),History & Philosophy of Science; Philosophy,254DK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000327144000006,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the combination of minds and machines through BCI's and intelligent devices (IDs) can affect a user's sense of agency. Particularly confusing cases can arise when the behavioral control switches implicitly from user to ID. I will suggest that in such situations users may be insecure about the extent to which the resulting behavior, whether successful or unsuccessful, is genuinely their own. Hence, while performing an action, a user of a BCI-ID may be uncertain about being the agent of the act.

But I would like to steer a middle course. I argue that the Gettier problem arises because knowledge is a thick concept, and a Gettier-like problem is just what we should expect from attempts at analyzing a thick concept. Section 2 is devoted to establishing the controversial claim that knowledge is thick, and, in Sect. 3, I show that there is a general problem for analyzing thick concepts of which the Gettier problem is a special instance.

A common response to experimental philosophical criticisms is to hold that only professional philosophers' intuitions count as evidence in philosophy. This expert intuitions defence' is inadequate for two reasons. First, recent studies indicate significant variability in professional philosophers' intuitions. Second, the academic literature on professional intuitions gives us reasons to doubt that professional philosophers develop truth-apt intuitions. The onus falls on those who mount the expert intuitions defence to meet these objections because it is implicitly being claimed that training and practice caused professional philosophers to acquire reliably accurate intuitions and we are owed an account of how this transformation takes place. A possible response to this situation is to attempt to reform philosophical practice to improve the quality of intuitions. Another possible response, advocated here, is to avoid appeals to intuitions as evidence.","[Clarke, Steve] Charles Sturt Univ, Ctr Appl Philosophy & Publ Eth, Bathurst, NSW 2795, Australia; [Clarke, Steve] Univ Oxford, Oxford Uehiro Ctr Pract Eth, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",Charles Sturt University; University of Oxford,"Clarke, S (corresponding author), Charles Sturt Univ, Ctr Appl Philosophy & Publ Eth, Bathurst, NSW 2795, Australia.",stclarke@csu.edu.au,,"Clarke, Steve/0000-0001-5692-0031",,,,,71,11,13,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0556-8641,1996-8523,,PHILOS PAP,Philos.

For example, seeing is importantly different from believing. And while what one sees clearly influences what one thinks, it is debatable whether what one believes and otherwise thinks can influence, in some direct and non-trivial way, what one sees. The latter possible relation is the cognitive penetration of perception. Cognitive penetration, if it occurs, has implications for philosophy of science, epistemology, philosophy of mind, and cognitive science. This paper offers an analysis of the phenomenon, its theoretical consequences, and a variety of experimental results and possible interpretations of them. The paper concludes by proposing some constraints for analyses and definitions of cognitive penetrability.","[Stokes, Dustin] Univ Utah, Dept Philosophy, 215 Cent Campus Dr 1140 E 800 S, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Stokes, D (corresponding author), Univ Utah, Dept Philosophy, 215 Cent Campus Dr 1140 E 800 S, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",dustin.stokes@utah.edu,,,,,,,93,95,107,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,1747-9991,,PHILOS COMPASS,Philos.

Pritchard, for instance, has suggested that only virtue-theoretic accounts have any hopes of adequately addressing these problems. By contrast, we argue that accounts of knowledge that are sensitive to the Gettier problem are able to overcome these challenges. To a first approximation, the Primary Value Problem is that of understanding how the property of being knowledge confers more epistemic value on a belief than does the property of being true. The Secondary Value Problem is one of understanding how, for instance, the property of being knowledge confers more epistemic value on a belief than does the property of being jointly true and justified. We argue that attending to the fact that beliefs are continuing states reveals that there is no difficulty in appreciating how knowledge might ordinarily have more epistemic value than mere true belief or mere justified true belief. We also explore in what ways ordinary cases of knowledge might be of distinctive epistemic value. In the end, our proposal resembles the original Platonic suggestion in the Meno that knowledge is valuable because knowledge is somehow tied to the good of truth.","[Carter, J.

Justifiers and truthmakers are treated in a similar way, exploiting the intuition that justifiers provide epistemic grounds for propositions to be considered true, while truthmakers provide ontological grounds for propositions to be true. This system of logic is then applied both for interpreting the notorious definition of knowledge as justified true belief and for advancing a new solution to Gettier counterexamples to this standard definition.","Catholic Univ Milan, Dept Philosophy, I-20123 Milan, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Giordani, A (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Milan, Dept Philosophy, I-20123 Milan, Italy.",alessandro.giordani@unicatt.it,,,,,,,15,7,7,0,3,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1755-0203,,,REV SYMB LOGIC,Rev.

It is argued that the conflict thesis is only meaningful when examined from a specific socio-historical perspective. The dialectical relation between science and religion should therefore be considered at both a macro and micro level. At the macro level broad changes in the meaning of science and religion occur; whereas at the micro level individuals immersed within particular expressions of these concepts socially construct, re-construct, and appropriate meaning. Specific attention is given to expressions of meaning surrounding sacred texts in this dialectical relation. Two ontological forms of meaning are examined through a qualitative content analysis of 16 interviews with individuals from various religious affiliation and academic attainment. A monistic ontology constructs textual meaning as facts that have the qualities of being both self-evident and certain. Potential tension arises with scientific discourse given empirical evidence may either confirm or conflict with scriptural interpretation. The pluralistic ontology constructs textual meaning with multiple categories, which in turn have the qualities of being mediated by human consciousness and uncertain. The science-religion dichotomy appears to be less susceptible to conflict given the uncertainty embedded in this construction of scriptural meaning. This paper implies that truth as correspondence may not necessitate the conflict thesis.","[Hathcoat, John D.] Oklahoma State Univ, Off Univ Assessment & Testing, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Habashi, Janette] Univ Oklahoma, Human Relat Dept, Tulsa, OK 74136 USA",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Tulsa,"Hathcoat, JD (corresponding author), Oklahoma State Univ, Off Univ Assessment & Testing, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",john.hathcoat@okstate.edu,"Habashi, PhD, Janette/JAC-0160-2023","Habashi, Janette/0009-0006-6173-1140",,,,,92,5,5,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1871-1502,1871-1510,,CULT STUD SCI EDUCAT,Cult.

This article returns to a theme addressed in Vol. 8(1) October 2002 of the journal: knowledge management and the problem of managing tacit knowledge. Method. The article is primarily a review and analysis of the literature associated with the management of knowledge. In particular, it focuses on the works of a group of economists who have studied the transformation of knowledge into information through the process of codification and the knowledge transaction topography they have developed to describe this process. Analysis. The article explores the theoretical and philosophical antecedents of the economists' views. It uses this as a basis for examining the dominant views of knowledge that appear in much of the literature on knowledge management and for performing a critical evaluation of their work. Results. The results of the analysis centre upon the question of when is it appropriate to codify knowledge. They present a basic summary of the costs and benefits of codification before looking in more detail at its desirability. Conclusions. The conclusions concern the implications of the above for knowledge management and the management of tacit knowledge. They deal with the nature of knowledge management, some of the reasons why knowledge management projects fail to achieve their expectations and the potential problems of codification as a strategy for knowledge management.","[Kimble, Chris] Euromed Management, F-13288 Marseille 9, France; [Kimble, Chris] Univ Montpellier 2, CREGOR, MRM, F-34095 Montpellier 5, France",Universite de Montpellier,"Kimble, C (corresponding author), Euromed Management, F-13288 Marseille 9, France.",chris.kimble@euromed-management.com,"Kimble, Chris/K-3562-2019","Kimble, Chris/0000-0002-7784-3837",,,,,71,21,32,1,27,UNIV SHEFFIELD DEPT INFORMATION STUDIES,SHEFFIELD,"UNIV SHEFFIELD, WESTERN BANK, SHEFFIELD S10 2TN, S YORKS, ENGLAND",1368-1613,,,INFORM RES,Inf.

However, it is far from clear that such deference to consensus is always justified. The existence of agreement in a community of researchers is a contingent fact, and researchers may reach a consensus for all kinds of reasons, such as fighting a common foe or sharing a common bias. Scientific consensus, by itself, does not necessarily indicate the existence of shared knowledge among the members of the consensus community. I address the question of under what conditions it is likely that a consensus is in fact knowledge based. I argue that a consensus is likely to be knowledge based when knowledge is the best explanation of the consensus, and I identify three conditions-social calibration, apparent consilience of evidence, and social diversity, for knowledge being the best explanation of a consensus.","Tel Aviv Univ, Edmond J Safra Ctr Eth, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel",Tel Aviv University,"Miller, B (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Edmond J Safra Ctr Eth, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",boaz.miller@utoronto.ca,,"Miller, Boaz/0000-0003-4329-1795",Azrieli Foundation,Azrieli Foundation,"I thank Hagit Benbaji, Joseph Berkovitz, Jim Brown, Anjan Chakravartty, Steve Fuller, Yves Gingras, Sandy Goldberg, Arnon Keren, Kareem Khalifa, Laszlo Kosolosky, Yakir Levin, Isaac (Yanni) Nevo, Isaac Record, Jacob Stegenga, Eran Tal, Brad Wray, and two anonymous reviewers for useful comments and suggestions.

This new epistemology of scientific evidence (ESE) models scientific knowledge as achieved through a process of marshaling evidence in a scientific inquiry that results in a convergence of scientific theories and research results. We show how a dialogue interface of argument from expert opinion, along with its set of critical questions, provides the argumentation component of the ESE. It enables internal scientific knowledge to be translated over into a wider arena in which individual nonexpert citizens and groups can make use of it. The external component shows how evidence is presented and used in a legal procedural setting that includes fact-finding, weighing the credibility of expert witnesses, and critical questioning of arguments.

J,"Comesaña, J",,,,"Comesana, Juan",,,EPISTEMIC PRAGMATISM: AN ARGUMENT AGAINST MODERATION,RES PHILOSOPHICA,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"By epistemic pragmatism in general I will understand the claim that whether propositions instantiate certain key epistemic properties (such as being known or being justifiably believed) depends not just on factors traditionally recognized as epistemic, but also on pragmatic factors, such as how costly it would be to the subject if the proposition were false. In what follows I consider two varieties of epistemic pragmatism. According to what I shall call moderate epistemic pragmatism, how much evidence we need in favor of a proposition in order to know that the proposition is true depends on our preferences. According to what I shall call extreme epistemic pragmatism, on the other hand, our preferences influence our epistemic position at a more basic level, because they help determine how much justification we actually have in favor of the proposition in question. Simplifying brutally, moderate epistemic pragmatism has it that the more worried we are about a proposition's being false, the more justification we need in order to know it, whereas extreme epistemic pragmatism has it that the more worried we are about a proposition's being false, the less justification we have for it. Recently, Fantl and McGrath have presented an interesting argument for moderate epistemic pragmatism, an argument which relies on the principle that (roughly) knowledge is sufficient for action (KA). In this paper I argue that KA, together with a plausible principle about second-order evidence, entails extreme epistemic pragmatism.","Univ Arizona, Dept Philosophy, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",University of Arizona,"Comesaña, J (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Philosophy, 213 Social Sci 1145 E South Campus Dr POB 210027, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",comesana@arizona.edu,"Comesana, Juan/G-5458-2013",,,,,,14,7,7,0,0,PHILOSOPHY DOCUMENTATION CENTER,CHARLOTTESVILLE,"PO BOX 7147, CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA 22906-7147 USA",2168-9105,2168-9113,,RES PHILOS,Res Philos.,APR,2013,90,2,,,,,237,260,,10.11612/resphil.2013.90.2.9,http://dx.doi.org/10.11612/resphil.2013.90.2.9,,,24,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,145PG,,Green Submitted,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000319028500009,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, I defend strongly verific (but not necessarily reliabilist) accounts of justification by claiming that there are two ways to construct a theory of justification: by analyzing our ordinary concept of justification or by taking justification to be a theoretic term defined by its role in the theory of knowledge. The former route is not promising because of the splintered nature of our ordinary concept of justification-or perhaps because there is no single such concept. On the other hand, if justification is defined by the role it plays in the theory of knowledge, then there is good reason to think that justification must be strongly truth-conductive since the term was introduced by Edmund Gettier to play the primary role in converting true belief into knowledge. And if that is right, then there will be no justified empirical belief at demon worlds. The real lesson of the demon world is then turned on its head: justification does not supervene on what one shares with one's deceived doppelganger.","Univ Arkansas, Dept Philosophy, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Senor, TD (corresponding author), Univ Arkansas, Dept Philosophy, 318 Old Main, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",senor@uark.edu,,,,,,,10,4,4,0,2,PHILOSOPHY DOCUMENTATION CENTER,CHARLOTTESVILLE,"PO BOX 7147, CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA 22906-7147 USA",2168-9105,2168-9113,,RES PHILOS,Res Philos.,APR,2013,90,2,,,,,203,214,,10.11612/resphil.2013.90.2.7,http://dx.doi.org/10.11612/resphil.2013.90.2.7,,,12,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,145PG,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000319028500007,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is widely accepted that the lesson to be learned from Gettier problems is that knowledge is incompatible with luck or at least a certain species thereof. As such, understanding the nature of luck is central to understanding the Gettier problem. Thanks by and large to Duncan Pritchard's seminal work, Epistemic Luck, a great deal of literature has been developed recently concerning the nature of luck and anti-luck epistemology. The literature, however, has yet to explore the very intuitive idea that luck comes in degrees. I propose that once luck is recognized to admit degrees even the slightest non-zero degree (of the relevant sort) precludes knowledge. Connecting this to Zagzebski's thesis, I propose that a given theory of warrant must guarantee truth in order to avoid Gettier counterexamples (or subsequently deny that warrant bears any relationship to the truth whatsoever), simply because a sufficient standard analysis of knowledge cannot allow for knowledge that is even marginally lucky.","Univ St Andrews, Dept Philosophy, St Andrews KY16 9AJ, Fife, Scotland",University of St Andrews,"Church, IM (corresponding author), Univ St Andrews, Dept Philosophy, St Andrews KY16 9AJ, Fife, Scotland.",ic63@st-andrews.ac.uk,,,,,,,16,13,18,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0966-8373,,,EUR J PHILOS,Eur.

It is argued through consideration of examples that this account gets the extension of 'adequately justified belief' at least roughly correct. A more theoretical reason is then offered to regard justification as the appearance of knowledge: If we have a knowledge norm for assertion, we do our best to comply with this norm when we express as assertions only beliefs that appear to us to be knowledge. If we are doing our best, there is little point in further sanctions. So a norm of knowledge for assertion would lead to a secondary norm of justified belief as the appearance of knowledge, marking a point at which our assertions may be corrected but should not be blamed.","Arizona State Univ, Sch Hist Philosoph & Religious Studies, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Reynolds, SL (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Hist Philosoph & Religious Studies, POB 874302, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",Steven.reynolds@asu.edu,,,,,,,40,19,20,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0031-8116,1573-0883,,PHILOS STUD,Philos.

To date, however, there are few challenges to research when the subjects are competent and the research is more than minimal risk with no promise of direct benefit. The principal reason given for allowing research that is more than minimal risk without benefit is that we should respect the autonomy of competent subjects. I argue that though the moral intuitions informing respect for autonomy are sound, there is another set of intuitions regarding what we take to be just treatment of another when one agent knowingly causes or allows suffering on another agent. I argue that concerns generated by commutative justice serve as limitations on permissible research. I highlight our intuitions informing this notion of justice by appealing to work done on theodicy; what counts as a morally sufficient reason for God to allow suffering in humans is applicable also to the researcher-subject relationship. I conclude that all human subjects who are exposed to more than minimal risk research should enjoy the same actual protections (e.g., subpart D) as those given subjects who cannot consent.","Villanova Univ, Dept Philosophy, Villanova, PA 19085 USA",Villanova University,"Napier, S (corresponding author), Villanova Univ, Dept Philosophy, SAC 108,800 Lancaster Ave, Villanova, PA 19085 USA.",stephen.napier@villanova.edu,,,,,,,47,1,1,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-7415,1573-1200,,THEOR MED BIOETH,Theor.

A heated debate exists, however. about what makes a belief justified. In this article, we examine the question of belief justification from a psychological perspective, focusing on the subjective confidence in a belief that the person has just formed. Participants decided whether to accept or reject a proposition depicting a social belief, and indicated their confidence in their choice. The task was repeated six times, and choice latency was measured. The results were analyzed within a Self-Consistency Model (SCM) of subjective confidence. According to SCM, the decision to accept or reject a proposition is based on the on-line sampling of representations from a pool of representations associated with the proposition. Respondents behave like intuitive statisticians who infer the central tendency of a population based on a small sample. Confidence depends on the consistency with which the belief was supported across the sampled representations, and reflects the likelihood that a new sample will yield the same decision. The results supported the assumption of a commonly shared population of representations associated with each proposition. Based on this assumption, analyses of within-person consistency and cross-person consensus provided support for the model. As expected, choices that deviated from the person's own modal judgment or from the consensually held judgment took relatively longer to form and were associated with relatively lower confidence, presumably because they were based on non-representative samples. The results were discussed in relation to major epistemological theories - foundational ism, coherentism and reliabilism. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

An acceptance rule assigns to each Bayesian credal state p a propositional belief revision method , which specifies an initial belief state that is revised to the new propositional belief state upon receipt of information E. An acceptance rule tracks Bayesian conditioning when , for every E such that p(E) > 0; namely, when acceptance by propositional belief revision equals Bayesian conditioning followed by acceptance. Standard proposals for uncertain acceptance and belief revision do not track Bayesian conditioning. The Lockean rule that accepts propositions above a probability threshold is subject to the familiar lottery paradox (Kyburg 1961), and we show that it is also subject to new and more stubborn paradoxes when the tracking property is taken into account. Moreover, we show that the familiar AGM approach to belief revision (Harper, Synthese 30(1-2):221-262, 1975; Alchourrn et al., J Symb Log 50:510-530, 1985) cannot be realized in a sensible way by any uncertain acceptance rule that tracks Bayesian conditioning. Finally, we present a plausible, alternative approach that tracks Bayesian conditioning and avoids all of the paradoxes. It combines an odds-based acceptance rule proposed originally by Levi (1996) with a non-AGM belief revision method proposed originally by Shoham (1987).","[Lin, Hanti; Kelly, Kevin T.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Carnegie Mellon University,"Kelly, KT (corresponding author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",hantil@andrew.cmu.edu; kk3n@andrew.cmu.edu,,,,,,,14,49,53,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0022-3611,,,J PHILOS LOGIC,J.

This principle is generally taken to be irreducible to standard Gricean reasoning because the forms that are in competition have the same assertive content. We suggest, however, that Maximize Presupposition might be reducible to the theory of scalar implicatures. (i)First, we consider a special case: the speaker utters a sentence with a presupposition p which is not initially taken for granted by the addressee, but the latter takes the speaker to be an authority on the matter. Signaling the presupposition provides new information to the addressee; but it also follows from the logic of presupposition qua common belief that the presupposition is thereby satisfied (Stalnaker, Ling Philos 25(5-6):701-721, 2002). (ii) Second, we generalize this solution to other cases. We assume that even when p is common belief, there is a very small chance that the addressee might forget it ('Fallibility'); in such cases, marking a presupposition will turn out to generate new information by re-establishing part of the original context. We also adopt from Raj Singh (Nat Lang Semantics 19(2):149-168, 2011) the hypothesis that presupposition maximization is computed relative to local contexts-and we assume that these too are subject to Fallibility; this accounts for cases in which the information that justifies the presupposition is linguistically provided. (iii) Finally, we suggest that our assumptions have benefits in the domain of implicatures: they make it possible to reinterpret Magri's 'blind' (i.e. context-insensitive) implicatures as context-sensitive implicatures which just happen to be misleading.","[Schlenker, Philippe] CNRS, Inst Jean Nicod, Paris, France; [Schlenker, Philippe] NYU, New York, NY USA",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); New York University,"Schlenker, P (corresponding author), CNRS, Inst Jean Nicod, Paris, France.",philippe.schlenker@gmail.com,,,,,,,46,68,80,1,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0925-854X,1572-865X,,NAT LANG SEMANT,Nat.

We argue that EBM is based upon reliabilist epistemological assumptions, and that this is appropriate we should focus on identifying the most reliable processes for generating and collecting medical knowledge. However, we note that this should not be reduced to narrow questions about which research methodologies are the best for gathering evidence. Reliable processes for generating medical evidence might lie outside of formal research methods. We also question the notion of the knower that is assumed by EBM. We argue that EBM assumes an enlightenment conception of knowers as autonomous, substitutable individuals. This conception is troubled by the way that clinicians learn the role of anecdote in health care and the role of patient choice, all of which bring into play features of clinicians and patients as situated individuals with particular backgrounds and experiences. EBM's enlightenment conception of the knower is also troubled by aspects of the way evidence is produced. Given these limitations, we argue that EBM should retain its reliabilist bent, but should look beyond formal research methodologies in identifying processes that yield reliable evidence for clinical practice. We suggest looking to feminist epistemology, with its focus on the standpoints of individual situated knowers, and the role of social context in determining what counts as knowledge.","[Hutchison, Katrina J.; Rogers, Wendy A.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Philosophy, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Rogers, Wendy A.] Macquarie Univ, Australian Sch Adv Med, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia",Macquarie University; Macquarie University,"Hutchison, KJ (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Philosophy, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",katrina.hutchison@mq.edu.au,,"Rogers, Wendy/0000-0001-9186-870X; Hutchison, Katrina/0000-0002-5817-7488",Australian Research Discovery Project Grant [DP120101092],Australian Research Discovery Project Grant(Australian Research Council),This research was supported by an Australian Research Discovery Project Grant (DP120101092).

Plato explores many alternative candidates of individuation accounts of objects of true belief, which he discards.

At the core of such adeptness is a relation of manifestation. Yet to require that relation within knowing is to reach for what amounts to an infallibilist conception of knowledge. And this clashes with the spirit behind the fallibilism articulated by Gettier when stating his challenge. So, Turri's form of response is irrelevant to that challenge, which was intended to pose a conceptual problem within fallibilist conceptions of knowledge. (And that failure on Turri's part needs to be highlighted to remind epistemologists of the need to assess Gettier cases by a fallibilist standard. Although that need was described earlier by Robert Almeder, apparently his advice is being overlooked.

The focus of that research has largely been on students' beliefs about knowledge and knowing; that is, how one understands what it means to know. In this article, we consider the characteristics of knowledge and knowing (i.e., epistemic frames) manifest in conceptual change investigations conducted by contemporary researchers. To accomplish this purpose, we took several steps. First, we reviewed philosophical writings pertaining to epistemology and epistemological beliefs, selected prominent stances toward epistemology (i.e., epistemic frames), and delineated the defining features of each (e.g., stances regarding knowledge or justification of knowledge). Then, to illustrate how these philosophical frames might translate into psychological research, we constructed prototypic conceptual change studies for each frame. Finally, we searched the conceptual change literature for studies manifesting evidence of the various epistemic frames. We conclude with potential applications of the epistemic frames in future conceptual change research and educational practice.","[Murphy, P.

This article examines the implicit moral psychology behind the idea that conversion is a 'colonization of consciousness', which it identifies as rooted in a secular liberal model of the self and of religion. The appeal of the conversion-as-conquest trope lies in its focus on power, but by building secular liberal assumptions into its theoretical optic it remains ironically blind to some of the most pervasive ways power operates today - namely, through the production of secular truths about religion, and by authorizing 'autonomous' secular subjectivities as normative. Drawing on examples from the author's research on Pentecostal conversion in Indian slums, and on a national context where violent anti-conversion activism is prevalent, the article argues that while both conversion and opposition to it entail power, this power is not well understood on the model of mental colonization, or 'resistance' by uncolonized subjectivities.","Max Planck Inst, Study Religious & Ethn Div, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Roberts, N (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst, Study Religious & Ethn Div, Herman Foge Weg 11, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",robertuncle@gmail.com,,,,,,,99,34,36,0,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1463-4996,1741-2641,,ANTHROPOL THEOR,Anthropol.

Findings indicate that the publication of more on change has not equated with more developed knowledge. As a community, change researchers are overwhelmingly focused on the most conservative type of progress, resulting in research that replicates rather than extends or develops, which ranks fairly low on a knowledge development scale.

Although little is known about how people attribute knowledge to others, philosophical debate about the nature of knowledge may provide a starting point. Traditionally, a belief that is both true and justified was thought to constitute knowledge. However, philosophers now agree that this account is inadequate, due largely to a class of counterexamples (termed Gettier cases) in which a person's justified belief is true, but only due to luck. We report four experiments examining the effect of truth, justification, and Gettiering on people's knowledge attributions. These experiments show that: (1) people attribute knowledge to others only when their beliefs are both true and justified: (2) in contrast to contemporary philosophers, people also attribute knowledge to others in Gettier situations; and (3) knowledge is not attributed in one class of Gettier cases, but only because the agent's belief is based on apparent evidence. These findings suggest that the lay concept of knowledge is roughly consistent with the traditional account of knowledge as justified true belief, and also point to a major difference between the epistemic intuitions of laypeople and those of philosophers.

Gilbert Ryle put in place most of the terms that have so far been distinctive of that debate, when he argued for knowledge-how's conceptual distinctness from knowledge-that. But maybe those terms should be supplemented, expanding the debate. In that spirit, the conceptual option of practicalism has recently entered the fray. Practicalism conceives anew the nature of knowledge-that, as being a kind of knowledge-how. In this paper we enlarge upon this conceptual suggestion.

As we showed in our paper - they are either would-be real experiments or stimulators of revealing convictions and opinions of people on which experiments are prosecuted. Besides the fact that thought experiments fulfill an illustrative and a fortiori persuasive function, they do not play any important theoretical role. They are simply exemplifications - usually inventive and funny ones - of some pure processes of reasoning. Their popularity has its source in the fact that since their childhood people like reading books with... illustrations. There would be nothing wrong with making use of such illustrations if texts in which they are described contained clearly expressed theses and transparently presented argumentation. Unfortunately texts - illustrated by thought experiments are lacking of such clarity and transparency. This is probably the reason for the fact that texts containing thought experiments are so widely commented. It is a very known truth that the less clear and transparent the text is, the more interpretative comments it needs.

My focus in this article is on the extent to which explanatory understanding, perhaps unlike knowledge, is compatible with certain forms of luck-the extent to which one can understand why something is the case when one is lucky to truly believe an explanatorily relevant proposition. I argue, contra Stephen Grimm ([2006]) and Duncan Pritchard ([2008], [2009]), that understanding quite generally is compatible with luckily believing a true, explanatorily relevant proposition. My strategy is to argue that various intuitions that seem to rule against lucky understanding can be explained away, and thus do not compel us to reject the thesis that, in general, understanding tolerates luck. In arriving at this conclusion, I address some salient issues regarding the testimony of others, and also draw out the consequences of my discussions for the status of understanding as a cognitive achievement.","No Arizona Univ, Dept Philosophy, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA",Northern Arizona University,"Morris, K (corresponding author), No Arizona Univ, Dept Philosophy, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA.",kevin.michael.morris@gmail.com,,,,,,,19,15,16,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0007-0882,1464-3537,,BRIT J PHILOS SCI,Br.

First, it asks whether causality is an adequate foundation for those theories of cognition and consciousness that are built upon it. The externalist revolution has reconceived all three dimensions of cognition - the semantic, the epistemological, and the mental - upon a foundation of 'causal connections of the appropriate type'. Yet these new theories almost completely ignore the long-standing controversies surrounding the very nature of causality, and the very real threat that 'causality' may be ill-equipped to do the work required of it. The second goal is to defend a kind of causality, largely ignored, that is grounded in the phenomenally conscious states of cognitive agents.

The main features of three different manifestations of virtue epistemology are first explained. Importantly, it is then maintained that developments in virtue epistemology may offer the resources to critique aspects of the debate between Hirst and Carr about how the philosophy of education ought to be carried out and by whom. Wilfred Carr's positionthat educational practitioners have privileged access to philosophical knowledge about teaching practicewill in particular be questioned. It will be argued that Carr's view rests on a form of epistemology, internalism, which places unreasonably narrow restrictions upon the range of actors and ways, in which philosophical knowledge of and/or for education might be achieved. In declaring that practical wisdom regarding teaching is entirely dependent on practitioner reflection, Carr not only radically deviates from Aristotle's notion of practical wisdom, he also, in effect, renders redundant all philosophical research about education that is not initiated by teachers in this manner. It is concluded that Aristotle's general approach to acquiring information and knowledge about the world might yet still offer a foundation for a more comprehensive philosophy of education; one that makes clear that the professional testimony and reflection of teachers, observation of teaching practice, and already existing educational philosophy, theory and policy can all be perceived as potentially valuable sources of philosophical knowledge of and for education.","Univ Manchester, Sch Educ, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Macallister, J (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Sch Educ, Room A6-8,Ellen Wilkinson Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",james.macallister@manchester.ac.uk,,,,,,,40,34,36,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0309-8249,1467-9752,,J PHILOS EDUC,J.

Based on cognitive considerations, Parmenides presents his thesis on the impossibility of knowing what is not (B2.5-8a) in order to establish what is as what is there to know (B2.2; B8.15-18), consequently allowing the identity of thinking and being (B3, B8.34).

This approach has inspired an exciting new spirit of collaboration between experimental philosophers and traditional epistemologists, who have begun using the techniques of the social sciences to investigate the factors that influence ordinary judgments about knowledge attribution. This paper provides an overview of some of the results these researchers have uncovered, suggesting that in addition to traditionally considered factors like evidence and justification, a number of important non-truth-conducive factors play significant roles in determining when people ascribe knowledge.

Upon discovery of a counterexample, this structure aids the search for a replacement hypothesis. The search is guided by heuristics. The heuristics of conceptual analysis are similar to those in other interesting areas of scholarship, and so hypotheses generated by it are of the right form to be applicable to diverse areas.

However, not all of these projects are successful. The task of defining what should be implemented into the configurator is much more complex than anticipated in many configurator projects. In the worst-case scenario, this implies that the configurator is never fully developed or it fails to support the users in a satisfactory manner. The difficulties in creating adequate specifications of what to implement in the knowledge base of a configurator have been explained in much of the configuration literature by the assumption that much of the relevant knowledge of the product experts is tacit. However, this paper shows that this kind of explanation can be misleading and may even be incorrect. This is accomplished by discussing the problems inherent in such explanations and through interviews with configuration project knowledge engineers. Therefore, according to this basis, this paper provides general recommendations concerning the use of the term tacit knowledge and outlines issues related to the acquisition of product knowledge in configuration projects.","[Haug, Anders] Univ So Denmark, Dept Entrepreneurship & Relationship Management, DK-6000 Kolding, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark,"Haug, A (corresponding author), Univ So Denmark, Dept Entrepreneurship & Relationship Management, Engstien 1, DK-6000 Kolding, Denmark.",adg@sam.sdu.dk,"Haug, Anders/ABE-2706-2020","Haug, Anders/0000-0001-6173-6925",,,,,58,6,6,0,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0890-0604,1469-1760,,AI EDAM,AI EDAM-Artif.

Why is knowledge valuable? In what way is knowledge more and better than merely true belief? This is a primary nature and value problems posed in Plato's Meno and Theaetetus. This paper focuses upon the nature problem and value problem of knowledge, especially upon the Gettier problem and the swamping problem, which are the central problems in the new value-driven epistemology. It is hoped that a general solution to the Gettier problem and the swamping problem can be found, and that the nature problem and the problem regarding the value of knowledge in epistemology will be satisfactorily addressed. There are different levels of suspicion concerning the nature and the value of knowledge, beginning with the most general suspicion that knowledge has any nature and any distinctive value at all. It then follows with the primary concern that why knowledge is more and better than merely true belief, the secondary concern that why knowledge is not justified true belief and why knowledge is more valuable than that which falls short of knowledge, and the tertiary concern that why knowledge cannot be defined and why knowledge has not just a greater degree but also a different kind of value than whatever falls short of knowledge. This paper also attempts to explore what those different levels of suspicions or the nature and value problems of knowledge really involve, and to show the philosophical significances of them. As we shall see, the question regarding what virtue epistemology is plays a central role in this paper.

J,"Moon, A",,,,"Moon, Andrew",,,Warrant does entail truth,SYNTHESE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Warrant; Infallibilism; Knowledge; Gettier,,"Let 'warrant' denote whatever precisely it is that makes the difference between knowledge and mere true belief. A current debate in epistemology asks whether warrant entails truth, i.e., whether (Infallibilism) S's belief that p is warranted only if p is true. The arguments for infallibilism have come under considerable and, as of yet, unanswered objections. In this paper, I will defend infallibilism. In Part I, I advance a new argument for infallibilism; the basic outline is as follows. Suppose fallibilism is true. An implication of fallibilism is that the property that makes the difference between knowledge and mere belief (which I dub 'warrant*') is the conjunctive property being warranted and true. I show that this implication of fallibilism conflicts with an uncontroversial thesis we have learned from reflection on Gettier cases: that nonaccidental truth is a constituent of warrant*. It follows that infallibilism is true. In the second part of the paper, I present and criticize a new argument against infallibilism. The argument states that there are plausible cases where, intuitively, the only thing that is keeping a belief from counting as knowledge is the falsity of that belief. Furthermore, it is plausible that such a belief is warranted and false. So, the argument goes, infallibilism is false. I show that this argument fails.","Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Moon, A (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",MoonAY@missouri.edu,,,,,,,17,12,15,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0039-7857,,,SYNTHESE,Synthese,FEB,2012,184,3,,,,,287,297,,10.1007/s11229-010-9815-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11229-010-9815-2,,,11,History & Philosophy Of Science; Philosophy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),History & Philosophy of Science; Philosophy,871RW,,Green Submitted,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000298756400005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Most philosophers believe that the answer is clearly 'no', as demonstrated by Gettier cases. But Gettier cases don't obviously refute the traditional view that knowledge is justified true belief (JTB). There are ways of resisting Gettier cases, at least one of which is partly successful. Nevertheless, when properly understood, Gettier cases point to a flaw in JTB, though it takes some work to appreciate just what it is. The nature of the flaw helps us better understand the nature of knowledge and epistemic justification. I propose a crucial improvement to the traditional view, relying on an intuitive and independently plausible metaphysical distinction pertaining to the manifestation of intellectual powers, which supplements the traditional components of justification, truth and belief.","Univ Waterloo, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of Waterloo,"Turri, J (corresponding author), Univ Waterloo, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.",john.turri@gmail.com,,,,,,,35,34,42,6,27,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0039-7857,1573-0964,,SYNTHESE,Synthese,FEB,2012,184,3,,,,,247,259,,10.1007/s11229-010-9773-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11229-010-9773-8,,,13,History & Philosophy Of Science; Philosophy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),History & Philosophy of Science; Philosophy,871RW,,Green Submitted,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000298756400003,View Full Record in Web of Science

In answer to this, this essay investigates a promising and alternative interpretative model of knowledge as structure or system in connection with Nelson Goodman's reflections. From a broad symbol-theoretical base it is possible to develop a plural and procedural concept of knowledge which is suitable for both the plurality of different forms of knowledge as well as its historical transformations. A decisive role is played here by the interpretation of understanding as a constructive process, which serves as the starting point of the theoretical description of a transformative dynamic. From the examination of the relation between processes of understanding and knowledge a new perspective emerges, which enables the surfacing of the procedural character of knowledge and its specific characteristics. This article offers thus the basis for a further differentiation of the epistemic field in which frame the notion of knowledge can be rehabilitated.","[Ammon, Sabine] Univ Basel, Basel, Switzerland",University of Basel,"Ammon, S (corresponding author), Univ Basel, Basel, Switzerland.",Sabine.Ammon@unibas.ch,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,0,UNIV AUTONOMA BARCELONA,BARCELONA,"SERVEI PUBLICACIONS, EDIFICI A, BELLATERRA, CARDANYOLA DEL VALLES, BARCELONA, 08193, SPAIN",0211-402X,2014-881X,,ENRAHONAR,Enrahonar,,2012,,49,,,,,11,28,,10.5565/rev/enrahonar.84,http://dx.doi.org/10.5565/rev/enrahonar.84,,,18,Philosophy,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Philosophy,V35ND,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-07-12,WOS:000215906400002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Furthermore, the study also aims to create linkage among the indicators of k-economy, economic integration process in the SAARC, and the knowledge conversion model. Design/methodology/approach - The paper adopts comparative analyses of the indicators of k-economy. Indicators are considered under three tracks such as: socio-economic, economic and ICT infrastructure. Socio-economic indicators - poverty index, literacy rate, public expenditure on education, R&D expenditure, enrolment of tertiary education, number of researchers in R&D, participation in international agency. Economic indicators -per-capita real GDP, real GDP growth rate, share of GDP by sector, structure of trade, inflation and unemployment rate. ICT infrastructure indicators-telephone main lines per 100 people, cellular users per 100 people, broadband per 100 people, and internet users per 100 people. The data are obtained from publications, existing reports and web sites of international organizations. Findings - The indicators of k-economy demonstrate deprived developmental status with increasing trends in the SAARC member countries. As a result, SAARC demonstrates poor growth in terms of knowledge development as compared to other economic integrations in Asia such as APT. There is a considerable variation in most of the indicators among the member states as measured by CV (coefficient of variation) although they lay in low-income county status. The people of the SAARC countries like to adopt with the ICT easily if the opportunity is provided. The study revealed that the countries in the SAARC should carefully follow the knowledge creation, conversion, implementation and reverse follow-up process to meet specific indicator based needs of the specific sector of particular members considering their social and financial affordability in the local context. Research limitations/implications - The study does not use the same year's data for all the indicators applied in this paper due to lack of data availability. Practical implications - The findings of this paper will be useful to formulate effective policies to improve the indicators of k-economy in the SAARC. This will be influential for the SAARC to be a competitive integration. Originality/value - This study provides comparative empirical evidence of variation in the indicators of k-economy among the SAARC member countries contribute to improve such indicators. The paper also creates linkage among the indicators of k-economy, economic integration process in the SAARC, and the knowledge conversion model.","[Hossain, Amzad] Al Ain Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Business Adm, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates",,"Hossain, A (corresponding author), Al Ain Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Business Adm, Al Ain, U Arab Emirates.",amzad4@yahoo.com,,,,,,,68,2,3,0,1,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1059-5422,2051-3143,,COMPET REV,Compet.

These require that the sender is capable, i.e. has sufficient incentives for acquiring true beliefs, and reliable, i.e. has sufficient incentives for truthfully communicating her beliefs. Focusing on the incentives in knowledge transfer reveals why some knowledge is more easily shared and what factors facilitate the transfer.

In this essay we evaluate Williamson's theory that knowledge is unanalyzable, as well as some replies, and conclude that his arguments against the possibility of analysis of knowledge only hold considering a common but, in our opinion, very stringent interpretation of 'analysis'. At the end of the essay we submit an alternative construal of 'analysis' which allows the possibility of an analytic elucidation of the concept of knowledge.

First, I use a Bayesian framework to show that in each of Sorensen's examples, knowledge-lies alter people's behavior by affecting their beliefs. Second, I show that while we can imagine lies that target knowledge without targeting beliefs, they cannot alter people's behavior.

The authors tested whether philosophers agree on the conceptual definition and the operational use of intuitions, and investigated whether specific demographic variables and philosophical specialisation influence how philosophers define and use intuitions. The results obtained point to a number of significant findings, including that philosophers distinguish between intuitions used to formulate (discovery) and to test (justification) philosophical theory. The survey results suggest that strategies implemented to characterise philosophical intuition are not well motivated since, even though philosophers do not agree on a single account of intuition, they fail to capture a preferred usage of intuitions as aspects of discovery. The quantitative summary of survey findings informs the debate on this topic, and advances more defined routes for subsequent approaches to the study of intuitions.","[Kuntz, J.

However, this intuition threatens to undermine virtue reliabilism according to which one knows that p if and only if one's believing the truth that p is the product of a reliable cognitive belief-forming process; in an obvious sense epistemic artifacts are not parts of one's overall cognitive system. This is so, unless the extended cognition hypothesis (HEC) is true. According to HEC when parts of the environment become properly coupled to the agent's brain then they too can be considered constitutive parts of the overall cognitive mechanism-i.e. cognition potentially extends to the world surrounding the agent. Interestingly, HEC and the broader framework of virtue reliabilism share some intriguing similarities, which render these two views mutually supportive. Making these similarities explicit provides a principled account of the way in which our knowledge-conducive cognitive characters may extend beyond our natural cognitive capacities by incorporating epistemic artifacts.","[Palermos, Spyridon Orestis] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Philosophy Psychol & Language Sci, Dugald Stewart Bldg Rm 2-16,3 Charles St, Edinburgh EH8 9AD, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Palermos, SO (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Sch Philosophy Psychol & Language Sci, Dugald Stewart Bldg Rm 2-16,3 Charles St, Edinburgh EH8 9AD, Midlothian, Scotland.",S.O.Palermos@sms.ed.ac.uk,,,,,,,61,38,39,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1878-5158,1878-5166,,REV PHILOS PSYCHOL,Rev.

Kotzee holds that, as in the case of ethics, one may distinguish between thick'' and thin'' concepts of epistemology and, further, that this distinction points to the importance of the study of the intellectual virtues in epistemology. Following Harvey Siegel, Kotzee contends that educated'' is a thick epistemic concept, and he explores the consequences of this for the subjects of epistemology and philosophy of education. Ultimately, Kotzee argues that its nature as a thick'' concept makes education suited to play an important role in explaining how the intellectual virtues can be acquired.","[Kotzee, Ben] Univ London, Birkbeck Coll, Dept Social Policy & Educ, 26 Russell Sq, London WC1B 5DQ, England",University of London; Birkbeck University London,"Kotzee, B (corresponding author), Univ London, Birkbeck Coll, Dept Social Policy & Educ, 26 Russell Sq, London WC1B 5DQ, England.",b.kotzee@bbk.ac.uk,,"Kotzee, Ben/0000-0003-0334-6368",,,,,28,10,13,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-2004,1741-5446,,EDUC THEORY,Educ.

According to a widely held view, philosophical intuitions provide an evidential basis for arguments against such theories, thus rendering the discussion rational. This method has been the predominant way to approach theories formulated as conditional or biconditional statements. In this paper, we examine selected theories of musical expressivity presented in such logical forms, analyzing the possibilities for constructing thought experiments against them. We will argue that philosophical intuitions are not available for the evaluation of the types of counterarguments that would need to be constructed. Instead, the evaluation of these theories, to the extent that it can succeed at all, will centrally rely on inferential, non-immediate access to our subjective musical experiences. Furthermore, attempted thought experiments lose their methodological function because no proper distinction can be drawn between the persons figuring in the thought-experimental scenario and the evaluator of the scenario. Consequently, some of the central contributions to what is generally understood to be analytic philosophy of art are shown to represent a form of aesthetic criticism, offering much less basis for rational argumentation than is often thought.","[Huovinen, Erkki] Univ Minnesota, Sch Mus, Minneapolis, MN 55414 USA; [Pontara, Tobias] Abo Akad Univ, Dept Musicol, SF-20500 Turku, Finland",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Abo Akademi University,"Huovinen, E (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Sch Mus, 80 Orlin Ave SE, Minneapolis, MN 55414 USA.",huovinen@umn.edu,,,,,,,33,4,4,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0031-8116,1573-0883,,PHILOS STUD,Philos.

MEN, WOMEN, AND PHILOSOPHICAL REASONING",EPISTEMOLOGIA,,,Italian,Article,,,,,,,SEX-DIFFERENCES; GENDER,"Why are there so few women in philosophy? Do women dislkes rigorous argumentation? Recently, Wesley Buckwalter e Stephen Stich have argued that women and men tend to have different philosophical intuitions and that these differences might play a role in explaining the underrepresentation of women in philosophy. To the contrary, in this paper, I defend the view that intuitions are in parr socially constructed and product of stereotypical behaviours. The paper is divided in two parts. In the first, I present Buckwalter and Stich's view as characterized by the two following theses: (i) there are significant differences between men and women in intuitive responses to some philosophically important thought experiments; (ii) women intuitions do not accord with those of professional philosophers insist are correct. In my analysis, particular attention is given on their hypothesis about the gender gap in academia as, in part, the result of a selection effect: women, because of the fact they do not have standard intuitions, become convinced they are not good in philosophy or are discouraged from continuing in philosophy. In the second part of the paper, I show why Buckwalter and Stich's approach is inadequate, by showing that the data in the works they reported are too low to support their conclusion (i.e. in many important thought experiments are no significant gender differences) and their thesis does not match with the idea the intelligence is not a fixed entity and the view that gender as social construction differs from one society to another. Gender differences in responses to thought experiments, I conclude, are not differences in intuitions per se, but in how women and men interpret the cases at issue, and are not an important part of the explanation for the gender gap in philosophy.","Univ Barcelona, Fac Filosofia, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Tripodi, V (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Fac Filosofia, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain.",,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,10,Croatian Sociological Assoc,Zagreb,"Amruseva 11/II, Zagreb, CROATIA",0392-9760,1825-652X,,EPISTEMOLOGIA,Epistemologia,JUL-DEC,2011,34,2,,,,,187,209,,,,,,23,History & Philosophy Of Science; Philosophy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),History & Philosophy of Science; Philosophy,930XD,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000303177200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, which started life as a letter to my departmental colleagues, I consider and respond to several reasons one might have for excluding Logic from the core requirements. I then give several arguments in favor of keeping Logic. The central and most important argument is that the lack of a proper background in logic makes it very difficult to approach many relatively straightforward philosophical arguments, let alone the more technical subliteratures of philosophy. In developing this argument, I consider a few core texts and arguments (e.g., Gettier's classic paper on the analysis of knowledge) and bring out how a student with some background in formal logic would be able to approach the texts and arguments with much greater ease than a student who lacks such a background.","[Decker, Jason] Carleton Coll, Dept Philosophy, Northfield, MN 55057 USA",Carleton College,"Decker, J (corresponding author), Carleton Coll, Dept Philosophy, Leighton Hall 307, Northfield, MN 55057 USA.",jdecker@carleton.edu,,,,,,,9,1,2,0,0,PHILOSOPHY DOCUMENTATION CENTER,CHARLOTTESVILLE,"PO BOX 7147, CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA 22906-7147 USA",0145-5788,,,TEACH PHILOS,Teach Philos.,JUN,2011,34,2,,,,,133,142,,10.5840/teachphil201134217,http://dx.doi.org/10.5840/teachphil201134217,,,10,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,781UH,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000291961500003,View Full Record in Web of Science

J,"Kriegel, U",,,,"Kriegel, Uriah",,,Two Defenses of Common-Sense Ontology,DIALECTICA,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"P>In a series of publications, Eli Hirsch has presented a sustained defense of common-sense ontology. Hirsch's argument relies crucially on a meta-ontological position sometimes known as 'superficialism'. Hirsch's argument from superficialism to common-sense ontology is typically resisted on the grounds that superficialism is implausible. In this paper, I present an alternative argument for common-sense ontology, one that relies on (what I argue is) a much more plausible meta-ontological position, which I call 'constructivism'. Note well: I will not quite argue that constructivism is true; merely that it is significantly more plausible than superficialism, and consequently affords a safer route to common-sense ontology. Thus my main goal in the paper is not quite to establish common-sense ontology, nor for that matter to refute Hirsch's argument for it. My goal is, in a way, more expressive than argumentative: I wish to articulate a novel meta-ontological position, one that I take to be in no way obviously less plausible than already familiar positions, and to point out that the position probably leads to common-sense ontology. I open, in section 1, with a discussion of Hirsch's argument and the main objection to it. I then develop, in section 2, a sketch of the alternative meta-ontology I have in mind. I close, in section 3, with the argument that this alternative meta-ontology, too, leads to common-sense ontology.","Univ Arizona, Dept Philosophy, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",University of Arizona,"Kriegel, U (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Philosophy, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",theuriah@gmail.com,,,,,,,39,9,12,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-2017,1746-8361,,DIALECTICA,Dialectica,JUN,2011,65,2,,,,,177,204,,10.1111/j.1746-8361.2011.01262.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1746-8361.2011.01262.x,,,28,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,767QK,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000290870900002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The starting point of the work are the problems raised by Edmund Gettier in his article Is Justified True Belief Knowledge? and the proposed solutions for these problems by some contemporary Russian philosophers.Three main approaches here are distinguished: a standard approach, a philosophy of science approach, and non-classical externalist approach.The standard approach is represented by theorists who are critical about Gettier's arguments as well as the arguments of his proponents. As an example of such theories the author analyzes the approach of Grigory Olkhovikov according to which the critics of the standard definition of propositional knowledge fail to offer a strict and correct argument in support of their views. In order to strengthen the standard definition he introduces a restriction according to which an argument for standard definition is to be based only on true premises. Some other of Olkhovikov's qualifications are discussed as well as his debate with Lev Lamberov. The author of the article sides with Olkhovikov approach claiming that all counterarguments in the spirit of Gettier against the standard approach in one way or the other end up being based on a false premise or a presupposition. In this section some other externalist arguments against the standard conception of propositional knowledge (e.g. the argument formulated by A.Goldman) are analyzed in the light of their discussion by such Russian philosophers as E.Vostrikova and A.Antonovski. The second approach to a definition of propositional knowledge (dubbed as that of philosophy of science) is discussed on the material of texts by A.Nikiforov and I.Kasavin. The author criticizes this approach for its methodological problems among which its use of a notion of false knowledge. Finally, the non-classical approach is discussed on the examples by social epistemological conception of I.Kasavin and A.Chemiak. Both are criticized for an unjustified broadening of the notion of knowledge. The author draws some conclusions about further possible problems within this area of contemporary Russian epistemology.","[Kusliy, P.

In this paper, we investigate the 'Chairman case', an influential case from this literature and disagree with this conclusion. Using a statistical method called structural path modeling, we show that people's attributions of intentional action to an agent are driven not by normative assessments, but rather by attributions of underlying values and characterological dispositions to the agent. In a second study, we examined people's judgments about what they think drives asymmetric intuitions in the Chairman case and found that people are highly inaccurate in identifying which features of the case their intuitions track. In the final part of the paper, we discuss how the statistical methods used in this study can help philosophers with the critical features problem, the problem of figuring out which among the myriad features present in hypothetical cases are the critical ones that our intuitions are responsive to. We show how the methods used in this study have some advantages over both armchair methods used by traditional philosophers and survey methods used by experimental philosophers.","[Sripada, Chandra Sekhar] Univ Michigan, Dept Philosophy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Sripada, CS (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Philosophy, 2215 Angell Hall 435 S State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",sripada@umich.edu,,"Konrath, Sara/0000-0001-9182-0095",,,,,28,53,60,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0268-1064,1468-0017,,MIND LANG,Mind Lang.,JUN,2011,26,3,,,,,353,380,,10.1111/j.1468-0017.2011.01421.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0017.2011.01421.x,,,28,"Linguistics; Psychology, Experimental",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Linguistics; Psychology,772RV,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000291253600004,View Full Record in Web of Science

J,"Klauk, T",,,,"Klauk, Tobias",,,Can Unreliable Narration Be Analyzed in Terms of Testimony?,JOURNAL OF LITERARY THEORY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The idea that unreliable narration can be analyzed in terms of testimony is attractive for two reasons. Firstly, the very idea of unreliable narration seems to be informed by the concept of testimony. Secondly, the concept is quite rich and allows for interesting insights into unreliability. Despite these advantages, applying the concept of testimony to unreliable narration is problematic. It can be shown that in interpreting narrations with covert narrators it is not helpful to talk in terms of testimony, while the concept does not apply at all to narrations without fictional narrators. The applicability further depends on the content of knowledge at stake. I argue that no narrations involve testimony by a fictional narrator, but that some narrations authorize imagining a fictional narrator giving fictional testimony. A short consultation of epistemology reveals that in fictional testimony two kinds of warrant are relevant, one fictional itself, one real. Finally, I argue that neither is it possible to stick to our everyday concept of testimony in analyzing unreliable narration, nor can core cases of unreliable narration be completely conceptualized in terms of testimony.","[Klauk, Tobias] Georg August Univ Gottingen, Courant Res Ctr Text Struct, Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Klauk, T (corresponding author), Georg August Univ Gottingen, Courant Res Ctr Text Struct, Gottingen, Germany.",,,,German Initiative of Excellence,German Initiative of Excellence,Work on this article has been funded by the German Initiative of Excellence.

In this paper I defend this view 'rationalism' against a recent objection by Timothy Williamson. I argue that his objection fails on multiple grounds, but the reasons why it fails are instructive. Williamson argues from a claim about the semantics of intuitive judgements, to a claim about their psychological underpinnings, to the denial of rationalism. I argue that the psychological claim that a capacity for mental simulation explains our intuitive judgements does not, even if true, provide reasons to reject rationalism. (More generally, a simulation hypothesis, about any category of judgements, is very limited in its epistemological implications: it is pitched at a level of explanation that is insensitive to central epistemic distinctions.) I also argue that Williamson's semantic claim that intuitive judgements are judgements of counterfactuals is mistaken; rather, I propose, they are a certain kind of metaphysical possibility judgement.

A dominant direction in such accounts is the idea that statistical evidence is lacking in some certain quality, making it epistemologically unwarranted for establishing the fact it is introduced to prove. Among the qualities suggested are luck, appropriate causal connection, weight, and case-specificity. Epistemic accounts thus constitute attempts to identify an intrinsic quality which individualised evidence (such as eyewitness testimony, confession, the individual's medical records) has but statistical evidence lacks, a quality which makes inference from the statistical evidence to the particular case epistemologically deficient. To the existing debate around epistemic accounts, this article adds several generic and inherent problems from which any epistemic account suffers. Based on these generic problems, it is concluded that the epistemic direction lacks potential.

For each such agent, in that context, two questions about trust are raised: Where an agent must access (or store) personal information, can one trust that artificial agent with that information and, where an agent does not need to either access or store personal information, can one trust that agent not to either access or store that information? It would be an infeasible task for any human being to explicitly determine, for each artificial agent, whether it can be trusted. That is, no human being has the computational resources to make such an explicit determination. There is a well-known class of problems in the artificial intelligence literature, known as frame problems, where explicit solutions to them are computationally infeasible. Human common sense reasoning solves frame problems, though the mechanisms employed are largely unknown. I will argue that the trust relation between two agents (human or artificial) functions, in some respects, is a frame problem solution. That is, a problem is solved without the need for a computationally infeasible explicit solution. This is an aspect of the trust relation that has remained unexplored in the literature. Moreover, there is a formal, iterative structure to agent-agent trust interactions that serves to establish the trust relation non-circularly, to reinforce it, and to bootstrap its strength.","[Buechner, Jeff] Rutgers Univ Newark, Dept Philosophy, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; [Buechner, Jeff] CUNY, Grad Ctr, Saul Kripke Ctr, New York, NY USA",Rutgers University System; Rutgers University Newark; City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Buechner, J (corresponding author), Rutgers Univ Newark, Dept Philosophy, Newark, NJ 07102 USA.",buechner@rci.rutgers.edu,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,0,MDPI AG,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2078-2489,,,INFORMATION,Information,MAR,2011,2,1,,,,,195,216,,10.3390/info2010195,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/info2010195,,,22,"Computer Science, Information Systems",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Computer Science,V18XM,,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-07-12,WOS:000214784100009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Stump's claims have been challenged by Milena Ivanova (2010) on the grounds that Duhem's 'epistemic aims' are more modest than those of virtue epistemologists. I challenge Ivanova's criticism of Stump by arguing that she not distinguish between 'reliabilist' and 'responsibilist' virtue epistemologies. Once this distinction is drawn, Duhem clearly emerges as a 'virtue-responsibilist' in a way that complements Ivanova's positive proposal that Duhem's 'good sense' reflects a conception of the 'ideal scientist'. I support my proposal that Duhem is a 'virtue-responsibilist' by arguing that his rejection of the possibility of our producing a 'perfect theory' reflects the key responsibilist virtue of 'intellectual humility'.

J,"Levine, A",,,,"Levine, Alex",,,Epistemic Objects as Interactive Loci,AXIOMATHES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Process metaphysics; Epistemology; Epistemic objects; Embodiment; Interactivism; Intersubjectivity,,"Contemporary process metaphysics has achieved a number of important results, most significantly in accounting for emergence, a problem on which substance metaphysics has foundered since Plato. It also faces trenchant problems of its own, among them the related problems of boundaries and individuation. Historically, the quest for ontology may thus have been largely responsible for the persistence of substance metaphysics. But as Plato was well aware, an ontology of substantial things raises serious, perhaps insurmountable problems for any account of our epistemic access to such things. Physical things are subject to change, and as such, they are poor objects of knowledge-if knowledge is to be more reliable than mere opinion. There is a reading of Plato's Theaetetus on which knowledge may be understood as a relation between an epistemic subject and a logos, where logoi are intrinsically dialectical, and where dialectic is a kind of intersubjective activity. Insofar as this epistemology may be attributed to Plato, the project of this paper is Platonic in spirit. It is also, in a sense, Kantian, in that it divorces ontology from the search for things-in-themselves, redirecting our attention from things to objects: epistemic objects. Such objects can be understood, as Maurice Merleau-Ponty proposed, as shared by multiple subjects by virtue of their participation in an intersubjective world, constituted by what Shaun Gallagher calls participatory sense-making. On an epistemology constructed in this way, the fact that both epistemic objects and their subject are mutable is no obstacle to knowledge. Far-from-equilibrium systems are forever mutable; at thermodynamic equilibrium, there would be neither subject, nor object. Epistemic objects, on this picture, are metastable loci of interactive potential.","Univ S Florida, Dept Philosophy, Tampa, FL 33620 USA",State University System of Florida; University of South Florida,"Levine, A (corresponding author), Univ S Florida, Dept Philosophy, 4202 E Fowler Ave,FAO 226, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",alevine@cas.usf.edu,,,,,,,14,3,5,1,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1122-1151,1572-8390,,AXIOMATHES,Axiomathes,MAR,2011,21,1,,,,,57,66,,10.1007/s10516-010-9132-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10516-010-9132-x,,,10,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,730GV,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000288022700004,View Full Record in Web of Science

To manifest an epistemic competence, a belief must satisfy two conditions: (1) it must derive from the exercise of a reliable belief-forming disposition in appropriate conditions for its exercise and (2) that exercise of the disposition in those conditions would not issue a false belief in a close possible world. Drawing on recent psychological research, I show that memories that are issued by episodic memory retrieval fail to satisfy either of these conditions. This presents Sosa, and other proponents of similar conditions (e.g. some safety theorists and process reliabilists), with a dilemma: (1) deny that episodic memories count as knowledge or (2) give up the conditions as necessary conditions on knowledge.

What role should intuitions play in philosophy? I present and examine the sceptical argument of experimental philosophers, and claim that experimental philosophers misunderstand the role of evidence in philosophy. My argument will utilize Goldman's view, according to which intuitions give reliable (though not infallible) evidence about a person's concepts, and this knowledge is valuable for further philosophical research as well. I will argue that the sceptical conclusions of experimental philosophers are harmless against this conception of philosophy, because even from a naturalist perspective certain kind of intuitive judgments about our concepts can be warranted, and this grants the specific epistemic status of intuitions. Of course, the reliability of introspection can be challenged. However, denying self-knowledge about my internal mental states is disputable as I will show - both from a philosophical and a scientific point of view.","Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Philosophy & Hist Sci, H-1111 Budapest, Hungary",Budapest University of Technology & Economics,"Hartl, P (corresponding author), Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Philosophy & Hist Sci, Egry Jozsef Srt 1, H-1111 Budapest, Hungary.",hp.hpeter@gmail.com,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,1,VYDAVATELSTVO SLOVENSKEJ AKAD VIED VEDA,BRATISLAVA,"DUBRAVSKA CESTA 9, BRATISLAVA, 84234, SLOVAKIA",1335-0668,2585-7150,,ORGANON F,Organon F,,2011,18,4,,,,,488,498,,,,,,11,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,970PX,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000306145900005,View Full Record in Web of Science

After discussing several alleged examples of seeing without knowing a new example is offered. Although both seeing and knowing are incompatible with luck, they are incompatible with different kinds of luck. Secondly, factive mental states that are more general than knowledge are conceivable. Williamson's characterisation of knowledge as being the most general factive mental state is not substantial enough to pick out exactly one state.

J,"Madison, BJC",,,,"Madison, B. J. C.",,,Combating Anti Anti-Luck Epistemology,AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MERELY TRUE BELIEF; KNOWLEDGE,"One thing nearly all epistemologists agree upon is that Gettier cases are decisive counterexamples to the tripartite analysis of knowledge; whatever else is true of knowledge, it is not merely belief that is both justified and true. They now agree that knowledge is not justified true belief because this is consistent with there being too much luck present in the cases, and that knowledge excludes such luck. This is to endorse what has become known as the 'anti-luck platitude'. But what if generations of philosophers have been mistaken about this, blinded at least partially by a deeply entrenched professional bias? There has been another, albeit minority, response to Gettier: to deny that the cases are counterexamples at all. Stephen Hetherington, a principal and vocal proponent of this view, advances what he calls the 'Knowing Luckily Proposal'. If Hetherington is correct, this would call for a major re-evaluation and re-orientation of post-Gettier analytic epistemology, since much of it assumes the anti-luck platitude both in elucidating the concept of knowledge, and in the application of such accounts to central philosophical problems. It is therefore imperative that the Knowing Luckily Proposal be considered and evaluated in detail. In this paper I critically assess the Knowing Luckily Proposal. I argue that while it draws our attention to certain important features of knowledge, ultimately it fails, and the anti-luck platitude emerges unscathed. Whatever else is true of knowledge, therefore, it is non-lucky true belief. For a proposition to count as knowledge, we cannot arrive at its truth accidentally or for the wrong reason.","Univ Notre Dame Australia, Fremantle, WA, Australia",The University of Notre Dame Australia,"Madison, BJC (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame Australia, Fremantle, WA, Australia.",,,,,,,,39,18,22,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0004-8402,,,AUSTRALAS J PHILOS,Australas.

A true belief based on a guess or hunch is not knowledge because it seems merely fortuitous, too much of an accident, and, well, lucky that one happened to get things right. Of course, true beliefs based on guesses and hunches are not justified. However, Gettier cases have persuasively shown that even justified true beliefs can admit knowledge-precluding kinds of luck. So in what sense are justified true beliefs that don't amount knowledge lucky or 'true only by chance'? I will address three different approaches to epistemic luck that have received significant attention in the recent literature: reliability approaches to epistemic luck, credit approaches to epistemic luck, and responsibilist or control approaches to epistemic luck. I will then turn my attention to the implications that epistemic luck has for other epistemic states. I will focus particularly on state of understanding and examine whether, and to what extent, understanding is vulnerable to epistemic luck.","[Orozco, Joshue] Whitworth Univ, Spokane, WA USA",Whitworth University,"Orozco, J (corresponding author), Whitworth Univ, Dept Philosophy, 300 W Hawthorne Ave, Spokane, WA 99218 USA.",jorozco@whitworth.edu,,,,,,,52,2,3,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1747-9991,,,PHILOS COMPASS,Philos.

One plausible reason for this disparity in learning is the difference in the existing personal knowledge held in the particular area in which the knowledge increase happens. To understand this further, in this paper knowledge is modelled as a 'system of cognitive schemata', and knowledge increase as a process in this system; the effect of existing personal knowledge on knowledge increase is 'the Learning Capability'. Learning Capability is obtained in form of a function, although it is merely a representation making use of mathematical symbolism, not a calculable entity. The examination of the function tells us about the nature of learning capability. However, existing knowledge is only one factor affecting knowledge increase and thus one component of a more general model, which might additionally include talent, learning willingness, and attention.

I argue that positing cross-cultural variation in subjects' implicit theories of knowledge is not the only possible explanation of the intuitions, and I suggest other explanations, including the hypothesis that each subject's implicit theory of knowledge might contain a heterogeneous set of heuristics for ascribing knowledge.

There is growing evidence of the influence of this line of thought. At the same time there is a growing body of work that has raised fundamental questions about the feasibility of the idea of evidence-based or evidence-informed practice. In this paper I make a further contribution to this discussion through an analysis of a number of assumptions that inform the discussion. I focus on the epistemological, ontological and praxeological dimensions of the discussion and in each domain identify a deficit. In the epistemological domain there is a knowledge deficit, in the ontological domain an effectiveness or efficacy deficit and in the practice domain an application deficit. Taken together these deficits not only raise some important questions about the very idea of evidence-based practice but also highlight the role of normativity, power and values. Against this background I outline the case for the idea of value-based education as an alternative for evidence-based education. As I am generally concerned about the expectations policy makers hold about what evidence can and should achieve in professional practices such as education, my contribution is primarily meant to provide educators and other professionals with arguments that can help them to resist unwarranted expectations about the role of evidence in their practices and even more so of unwarranted interventions in their practices.","Univ Stirling, Stirling Inst Educ, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland",University of Stirling,"Biesta, GJJ (corresponding author), Univ Stirling, Stirling Inst Educ, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",gert.biesta@stir.ac.uk,"Biesta, Gert J J/C-1318-2010","Biesta, Gert/0000-0001-8530-7105",,,,,33,394,451,5,162,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0039-3746,1573-191X,,STUD PHILOS EDUC,Stud.

Some of them discuss the necessity of the causal condition for justification, which creates the grounds for renewing the old conflict between empiricists and rationalists. Emphasizing the condition of causality as necessary for justifiability, causal theory has provided stimulus for the contemporary empiricists to venture on the so far unquestioned cognitive foundations of mathematics. However, in what sense can we speak about the justifiability as causality when it comes to mathematical knowledge? Can we justify the mathematical statement 2+2=4 by means of causality-perceptibility? Do we need perceptibility, a visual image of apples and marbles we add up in our first mathematics lesson, in order to know that statement? Does the same go with the statement that any two points can be joined by a straight line, and that the sum of angles in any triangle is the angle the measure of which equals the sum of the measures of the two right angles? Even though the major part of this article offers a review of the attitudes of various authors who endeavor to discuss the application of the causal theory to the problem of understanding of mathematical knowledge, it advocates the idea that knowledge expressed in a mathematical statement is acquired and transmitted by evidence. Evidence is by itself a guarantee of truth. It convinces us of the accuracy of mathematical truths. Proving, we find out. The greatest part of what we know (claim to know) is based on evidence of the previous knowledge (claims). Due to the previous knowledge, we can say that knowledge in mathematics is in itself different from the knowledge in empirical sciences, i.e it does not require causal relation that is considered necessary condition of knowing in those sciences.","Univ Crne Gore, Filozofski Fak, Niksic 81402, Montenegro",University of Montenegro,"Drekalovic, V (corresponding author), Univ Crne Gore, Filozofski Fak, Danila Bojovica 3, Niksic 81402, Montenegro.",,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,1,SOC ADVANCEMENT PHILOSOPHY-ZAGREB,ZAGREB,"UNIV ZAGREB-CROATIAN STUDIES, BORONGAJ CAMPUS, BORONGAJSKA CESTA 83D, ZAGREB, HR-10000, CROATIA",1333-4395,,,PROLEGOMENA,Prolegomena,MAY,2010,9,1,,,,,97,+,,,,,,27,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,667NY,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000283202000005,View Full Record in Web of Science

We analyze whether executives' characteristics affect strategic choices due to bounded rationality, as proposed by the theory of upper echelons. The literature has thus far not empirically opened this black box. Relying on psychological economics, we develop hypotheses under which conditions expertise and gender can lead to biased information-processing. Research Findings/Insights: To test the hypotheses, we propose a two-study methodology and take the financial crisis as a natural experimental setting. In Study 1, we analyze individual phenomena and show that under conditions of uncertainty, the processing of information by financial experts and men is worse than by non-financial experts and women. In Study 2, we test these findings for organizational phenomena. We show that banks with a higher percentage of financial experts within TMTs perform better in stable environments, but are more negatively affected by the financial crisis. Theoretical/Academic Implications: An important moderator within the theory of upper echelons is financial market discipline during turbulent periods, explaining why the performance of homogenous TMTs is volatile and why the performance of diverse TMTs is sustainable. The theory can be strengthened by including the insights of psychological economics as a micro-foundation. Practitioner/Policy Implications: For a sustainable performance, greater TMT diversity in public companies should be instituted by the board of directors.","[Rost, Katja] Univ Zurich, Inst Org & Adm Sci, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Rost, K (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Inst Org & Adm Sci, Univ Str 84, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",katja.rost@iou.uzh.ch,"Rost, Katja/N-3420-2013","Rost, Katja/0000-0002-7752-7818",,,,,159,51,67,2,107,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0964-8410,1467-8683,,CORP GOV-OXFORD,Corp.

Second, it argues that there is a deeper connection between knowledge and legal proof than is typically argued for or presupposed in the legal literature. This connection is illustrated through a discussion of the Gettier problem in epistemology.

Inequality resulting from brute bad luck is not justified. I argue that luck, and therefore responsibility, are defined in terms of the reward structure. Luck and responsibility are epiphenomena of the incentives that people have to choose from the opportunity sets available. To that end egalitarians should look more directly at the degree of inequality that is acceptable and examine more closely the classes of actions they want to leave to individual responsibility even though these will lead to greater inequality. State action should concentrate upon reducing inequality between classes of people; it cannot be expected to reduce all inequalities between people even though many of these will have only peripheral relationships to responsibility.","[Dowding, Keith] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Social Sci, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University,"Dowding, K (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Social Sci, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",keith.dowding@anu.edu.au,,"Dowding, Keith/0000-0001-6888-9369",,,,,35,5,5,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-8230,1743-8772,,CRIT REV INT SOC POL,Crit.

I construct a case that arguably falsifies this principle and consider five available lines of response that might help retain Counter-Closure. I argue that three are problematic. Of the two remaining lines of response, the first relies on non-universal intuitions and forces one to view the case I construct as exhibiting a justified, true belief to which none of the usual diagnoses of knowledge failure in Gettier cases apply. The second line involves claiming that Fake Barns and its ilk are misdiagnosed by epistemological orthodoxy as Gettier cases. We are thus confronted by a trilemma: either the case I discuss undermines the first-blush plausible principle of Counter-Closure; or the case I discuss instantiates a novel kind of Gettier case; or a popular conception of a key range of alleged Gettier cases must be rejected.

The argument from intuition without beliefs threatens to undercut any such doxastic account: since there are clear cases of intuition without belief, intuitions cannot be beliefs. Advocates of the intellectual seeming account conclude that intuitions belong to the basic mental kind of intellectual seeming. I argue that rightly understood, apparent cases of intuition without belief are cases of someone having the inclination to believe that p whilst believing that not-p. These can be accommodated by a disjunctive doxastic account holding that to have an intuition is to either have a belief, or to have an inclination to believe. I conclude that intuitions reduce to beliefs, and that there is no need to acknowledge intellectual seemings as basic states in our mental taxonomy.","Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Nimtz, C (corresponding author), Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Bismarckstr 1, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany.",christian.nimtz@phil.uni-erlangen.de,,,,,,,47,5,7,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0951-5089,1465-394X,,PHILOS PSYCHOL,Philos.

Claims in orientational matters, sometimes connected to attempts to establish them as a rule for legislation, have often been in conflict with the justified claims of non-believers. In addition they violate the Principle of Autonomy of the individual, which is at the very heart of European identity so decisively shaped by the Enlightenment. The Principle of Autonomy implies that state legislation should not interfere in the life of individual citizens, as long as his or her actions do not violate the rights of others. This paper-using the example of the theory of evolution-rejects ecclesiastical claims to theoretical knowledge as completely unfounded and preposterous. In the case of orientational knowledge-using the example of euthanasia-ecclesiastical claims to (universalizable) knowledge are shown to be unfounded as well. The Church's position with respect to euthanasia and a range of other bio-ethical topics, such as pre-marital sex, contraception, abortion, indissolubility of marriage, and homosexuality, rests on a very peculiar ethical position. This ethical position is the natural right theory, which-far from being universalizable-is shared by very few people. Among other things, this position presupposes the belief in God as the creator of nature, and the assumption that ethical norms can be derived from this premise. Thus ecclesiastical knowledge claims, cannot be justified in a way which could be reasonably supposed to be universally acceptable. Kant (see the quote) was the first to require this sort of justification. Claims that fail to implement Kant's stipulations should be eliminated by what I would like to call Kant's razor.","[Wolters, Gereon] Univ Konstanz, Fachbereich Philosophie D15, D-78457 Constance, Germany; [Wolters, Gereon] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Coll Adv Studies, Helsinki 00014, Finland",University of Konstanz; University of Helsinki,"Wolters, G (corresponding author), Univ Konstanz, Fachbereich Philosophie D15, D-78457 Constance, Germany.",gereon.wolters@uni-konstanz.de,,,,,,,46,1,1,1,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1122-1151,,,AXIOMATHES,Axiomathes,DEC,2009,19,4,,,,,481,508,,10.1007/s10516-009-9092-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10516-009-9092-1,,,28,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,524BJ,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000272118500010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Three notions of definability are considered: explicit definability, implicit definability, and reducibility, where explicit definability is equivalent to the combination of implicit definability and reducibility. It is shown that if knowledge satisfies any set of axioms contained in S5, then it cannot be explicitly defined in terms of belief. S5 knowledge can be implicitly defined by belief, but not reduced to it. On the other hand, S4.4 knowledge and weaker notions of knowledge cannot be implicitly defined by belief, but can be reduced to it by defining knowledge as true belief. It is also shown that S5 knowledge cannot be reduced to belief and justification, provided that there are no axioms that involve both belief and justification.","[Halpern, Joseph Y.] Cornell Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Samet, Dov] Tel Aviv Univ, Fac Management, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Segev, Ella] Technion Israel Inst Technol, Fac Ind Engn & Management, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel",Cornell University; Tel Aviv University; Technion Israel Institute of Technology,"Halpern, JY (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",halpern@cs.cornell.edu; samet@post.tau.ac.il; esegev@ie.technion.ac.il,"Segev, Ella/F-1628-2012","Segev, Ella/0000-0003-4445-2562",Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [0812045] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Div Of Information & Intelligent Systems; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),,,20,31,36,0,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1755-0203,,,REV SYMB LOG,Rev.

With language data drawn from Luoping Nase (a Tibeto-Burman language spoken in the P.R. of China and belonging to the Yi Nationality), I illustrate that epistemic modals clash with clauses articulating first-hand information. I then demonstrate that existing models such as Kratzer's graded possible-worlds semantics fail to provide accurate truth conditions for modals tagging clauses with first-hand information. As a remedy I propose a fuzzy version of possible-worlds semantics with various grades of belief and knowledge. In addition to preserving the expressive power of graded possible-worlds semantics, the fuzzy model will be shown to supply appropriate truth conditions for epistemic modals appended to evidential clauses (i.e. clauses expressing first-hand information).","City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Chinese Translat & Linguist, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",City University of Hong Kong,"Gerner, M (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Chinese Translat & Linguist, 83 Tat Chee Ave, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",mgerner@cityu.edu.hk,"Gerner, Matthias/AAV-3313-2020","Gerner, Matthias/0000-0002-6934-3381",,,,,55,5,5,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0157,1573-0549,,LINGUIST PHILOS,Linguist.

In the first, knowledge is hypothesized to refer to mental states causally responsible for the behaviour of cognitive agents. Here, the relational character of truth creates a problem. In the second hypothesis knowledge is hypothesized to refer to mental states causally responsible for the evolutionarily successful behaviour of cognitive agents. Here, the problem lies in the fact that evolution by natural selection is not necessarily conducive to truth.

My aim in this paper is to critically examine the sort of externalism that accompanies the most promising of the proposed fourth conditions, due to Pollock, in order to offer some fresh insights on this old epistemological issue. I argue that Pollock's paradigmatic treatment of the matter gives rise to a critical problem with regard to the exact role of the fourth condition and its relation with the onto-semantic or alethic condition of propositional knowledge, to wit, truth. In the light of this discussion, I draw certain conclusions about epistemic externalism and point out some of its theoretical shortcomings.","Bogazici Univ, Dept Philosophy, TR-34342 Istanbul, Turkey",Bogazici University,"Baç, M (corresponding author), Bogazici Univ, Dept Philosophy, TR-34342 Istanbul, Turkey.",muratbac@gmail.com,"BAC, MURAT/AAZ-8080-2020",,,,,,25,1,1,0,0,VYDAVATELSTVO SLOVENSKEJ AKAD VIED VEDA,BRATISLAVA,"DUBRAVSKA CESTA 9, BRATISLAVA, 84234, SLOVAKIA",1335-0668,,,ORGANON F,Organon F,,2009,16,2,,,,,127,145,,,,,,19,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,452GM,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000266528300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is argued that the use to which those principles are put in such a task is inappropriate. In order to object to the JTB-analysis, the principles are conceived of as independent of the way the search for knowledge is conducted and as valid a priori. As against this and from a Pragmatist stance, the principles are distilled within the practice of skilled inquiry and within the gathering of epistemic warrant. Finally, this explanation of why Gettier's attack on the JTB-analysis fails is shown to be akin to Dewey's views of the nature of logical truths and to Drestke's arguments of why neither knowledge nor epistemic warrants are closed under logical entailment.","Univ Granada, Dept Filosofia, E-18011 Granada, Spain",University of Granada,"Acero, JJ (corresponding author), Univ Granada, Dept Filosofia, Campus Cartuja, E-18011 Granada, Spain.",acero@ugr.es,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,1,KRK EDICIONES,OVIEDO,"ALVAREZ LORENZANA, 27, OVIEDO, 33006, SPAIN",0210-1602,,,TEOREMA,Teorema,,2009,28,3,,,,,49,63,,,,,,15,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,511JG,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000271159700004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Contextualism does entail that some speakers suffer from semantic blindness; however, at its roots, this blindness concerns not the context-sensitivity of knowledge claims, but the question whether knowledge sentences possess context-independent truth conditions.

J,"Vaselli, S",,,,"Vaselli, Stefano",,,THE PARADOX OF CONCEPTUAL DETERMINATION,EPISTEMOLOGIA,,,Italian,Article,,,,,,,,"The article endorses a radical criticism of the conceptualistic view about experience as a wholly-immediately conceptualized state, and it provides, at this purpose, two conceptual claims. The first one derives all its force from an operational isomorphism between the structure of the well-known F. Fitch-J. Kvanvig' knowability paradox, stated within the demonstration of Fitch theorem, (by which p=every truth is knowable iff every truth is known is a logical truth) and another one, which we suggest to define as paradox of conceptual undetermination. By means of this tool it is always possible to find an isomorphic statement to p, as q=every empirical content is conceptualizablee iff every empirical content is conceptualized, which has the same troubles as p, owing to two different and peculiar logical properties of factivity and conjunction's distributivity, which (as well showed by N. Tennant and J. Kvanvig) are always present within the knowledge, conceived as a logical operator. So, under the assumption of intrinsic presence of conceptualization in every epistemic state of mind (following the same McDowell' thesis), once we have stated the presence of the same properties in conceptualization, we should conclude that every conceptualization too has the same fatal trend to fall in a self-contradiction caused by these two properties indeed. In this case, as far as for knowledge, the only main way to avoid self-deceit is to deny the knowability thesis (every truth is knowable), also for conceptualization as well the only device to avoid contradiction is to deny conceptualism, i.e. every empirical content is always conceptualizable. The final claim completes the article's task with a description of the phenomenological roots of our common sense bias-image of a immediate activation of concepts in every act of our consciousness, trying to show why it sounds to our consciousness intuition so good. To outline this framework, theoretical criteria of conceptualization of conscious content are given, following G. Evans e T. Crane' insight about the nature of consciousness of belief and imagination.","Univ Roma La Sapienza, Grp APhEx Analyt & Philosoph Explanat, Cattedra Filosofia Sci 1, Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Vaselli, S (corresponding author), Univ Roma La Sapienza, Grp APhEx Analyt & Philosoph Explanat, Cattedra Filosofia Sci 1, Rome, Italy.",,,"VASELLI, Stefano/0000-0003-4785-2182",,,,,43,0,0,0,1,TILGHER-GENOVA S A S,GENOA,"VIA ASSAROTTI 31/15, 16122 GENOA, ITALY",0392-9760,,,EPISTEMOLOGIA,Epistemologia,JAN-JUN,2009,32,1,,,,,71,90,,,,,,20,History & Philosophy Of Science; Philosophy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),History & Philosophy of Science; Philosophy,510JR,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000271085000003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Given both a pragmatist as well as a veritist understanding of epistemic value, it is argued that a reliabilist analysis of knowledge, in general, promises a hopeful strategy to explain the extra value of knowledge. It is, however, shown that two recent attempts to solve Meno's Problem within reliabilism are severely flawed: Olsson's conditional probability solution and Goldman's value autonomization solution. The paper proceeds with a discussion of the purpose of having a higher value of knowledge as opposed to merely true belief, both in evolutionary and social terms. It claims that under a reliabilist analysis of knowledge it can be explained how knowers could evolve rather than just truthful believers. Subsequently, the paper develops an account of how we can manipulate our testimonial environment in an epistemically beneficial way by valuing reliably produced true belief more that just true belief and so gives an indirect justification of the extra value of knowledge.","[Werning, Markus] Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany",Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf,"Werning, M (corresponding author), Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.",,,,,,,,28,3,3,0,0,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",0165-9227,1875-6735,,GRAZER PHILOS STUD,Grazer Philos.

Justification Logic is based on classical propositional logic augmented by justification assertions t : F that read t is a justification for F. Justification Logic absorbs basic principles originating from both mainstream epistemology and the mathematical theory of proofs. It contributes to the studies of the well-known Justified True Belief vs. Knowledge problem. We state a general Correspondence Theorem showing that behind each epistemic modal logic, there is a robust system of justifications. This renders a new, evidence-based foundation for epistemic logic. As a case study, we offer a resolution of the Goldman-Kripke 'Red Barn' paradox and analyze Russell's 'prime minister example' in Justification Logic.

Current models for belief suffer from two difficulties. One is the well known problem of logical omniscience which tends to follow from most models. But a more important one is the fact that most models do not even attempt to answer the question what it means for someone to believe something, and just what it is that is believed. We provide a flexible model which allows us to give meaning to beliefs in general contexts, including the context of animal belief (where action is usually our only clue to a belief), and of human belief which is expressed in language.","[Parikh, Rohit] CUNY, Dept Comp Sci, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Parikh, Rohit] CUNY, Dept Math, New York, NY 10016 USA; [Parikh, Rohit] CUNY, Dept Philosophy, New York, NY 10016 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; City University of New York (CUNY) System; City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Parikh, R (corresponding author), CUNY, Dept Comp Sci, New York, NY 10016 USA.",rparikh@gc.cuny.edu,,,PSC-CUNY faculty research assistance program,PSC-CUNY faculty research assistance program,"We thank Sergei Artemov, Can Baskent, Samir Chopra, Horacio Arlo Costa, Juliet Floyd, Haim Gaifman, Isaac Levi, Mike Levin, Larry Moss, Eric Pacuit, Catherine Wilson, and Andreas Witzel for comments.

J,"Davies, T",,,,"Davies, Tamsin",,,University-Industry Links and Regional Development: Thinking beyond Knowledge Spillovers,GEOGRAPHY COMPASS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The use, nature and movement of knowledge have a central place in recent debates concerning contemporary economies. Within this context, knowledge spillovers from universities to industry are believed to be an important driver of innovation. Because these spillovers are thought to be geographically localised, they have a potentially important role in developing the regional economy. However, the concept of the knowledge spillover, although widely accepted in the literature, is not unproblematic. This article explores the theoretical assumptions behind the academic knowledge spillover, namely that academic knowledge is a public good, inherently tacit and context-independent. It argues that such assumptions make knowledge spillovers between universities and firms appear more likely than they in fact are. Instead, a mixture of informal and formal, market-related activities enable knowledge flow between universities and industry. Knowledge flows are governed by processes of transfer, translation and transformation that impact on the mobilities of different types of knowledge. However, the mechanisms authors have proposed for knowledge spillovers, such as social networks, are still important. As far as the contributions, such linkages make to regional development are concerned, these may be affected by both the socio-cultural environment of the region and extra-regional factors.","[Davies, Tamsin] Aberystwyth Univ, Inst Geog & Earth Sci, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales",Aberystwyth University,"Davies, T (corresponding author), Aberystwyth Univ, Inst Geog & Earth Sci, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales.",ted@aber.ac.uk,,"Davies, Tamsin/0009-0007-9219-3952",,,,,67,1,2,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1749-8198,,,GEOGR COMPASS,Geogr.

While there has been much discussion of Jackson's claim that we have such knowledge, there has been comparatively little discussion of this most powerful argument for that claim. Here I defend an alternative explanation of our intuitions about possible cases, one that does not rely on a priori extension-fixers. This alternative explanation provides a vindication of our reliance on intuitions, while blocking Jackson's abductive argument for a priori semantic knowledge. In brief, I argue that we should regard our armchair intuitions as providing an important, a priori source of evidence for hypotheses about the contents of our implicit referential policies with regard to our terms. But all such hypotheses have a potential falsifier that is only discoverable empirically. In other words, gold-standard evidence for such hypotheses is always empirical.","Univ Nebraska, Dept Philosophy, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA",University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Dowell, JL (corresponding author), Univ Nebraska, Dept Philosophy, 1010 Oldfather Hall,POB 880321, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.",janicedowell@hotmail.com,,,,,,,30,8,8,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0031-8116,1573-0883,,PHILOS STUD,Philos.

No matter how strong such theories require inductive grounds to be if a belief based on them is to qualify as knowledge, there are certain beliefs (namely, about the outcome of fair lotteries) that are based on even stronger inductive grounds, while, intuitively, they do not qualify as knowledge. This paper discusses what is often regarded as the most promising classical invariantist solution to the puzzle, namely, that beliefs about the outcomes of fair lotteries do not qualify as knowledge because they are too lucky to do so (or, relatedly, because they do not satisfy a safety condition on knowledge), while other beliefs based on potentially weaker inductive grounds are not too lucky (or, relatedly, because they are safe). A case is presented that shows that this solution to the puzzle is actually not viable. It is argued that there is no obvious alternative solution in sight and that therefore the puzzle still awaits a classical invariantist solution.","Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Philosophy, Louvain, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Kelp, C (corresponding author), Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Philosophy, Louvain, Belgium.",,"Kelp, Christoph/AGK-3359-2022","Kelp, Christoph/0000-0001-7735-2109",,,,,26,2,2,0,3,SOUTHERN J PHILOSOPHY UNIV MEMPHIS,MEMPHIS,"DEPT PHILOSOPHY, MEMPHIS, TN 38152 USA",0038-4283,,,SOUTHERN J PHILOS,South.

According to Heim (1991), Percus (2006), and Sauerland (2006), this inference should follow from the comparison of (1) to (1a). However, such an analysis would only predict a very weak implicature: it is not common belief that the speaker has a sister. I propose to strengthen this prediction by two means. First, I rely on a precise understanding of the modern Stalnakerian view of presuppositions and common ground (Stalnaker 1998, 2002; von Fintel 2000; Schlenker 2006). Second, I argue that this inference depends on contextual factors. More precisely, I show that the Competence Assumption (see Spector 2003; van Rooij & Schulz 2004; Sauerland 2004) necessary to obtain secondary scalar implicatures should be supplemented with an Authority Assumption. I motivate this additional assumption on independent empirical grounds. Finally, I show how my proposal accounts for a wide variety of inferences with fine variations governed by (i) contextual differences and (ii) specific properties of the presupposition triggers involved.","Ecole Normale Super, Lab Sci Cognit & Psycholinguist, F-75230 Paris 5, France",Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS),"Chemla, E (corresponding author), Ecole Normale Super, Lab Sci Cognit & Psycholinguist, 29 Rue Ulm, F-75230 Paris 5, France.",chemla@ens.fr,,"Chemla, Emmanuel/0000-0002-8423-5880",,,,,34,40,47,1,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0167-5133,1477-4593,,J SEMANT,J.

I argue that an incompatibilist about determinism and moral responsibility can safely ignore so-called Frakfurt-style cases and continue to argue for incompatibilism on the grounds that determinism rules out the ability to do otherwise. My argument relies on a simple-indeed, simplistic-weakening of the principle of alternate possibilities that is explicitly designed to be immune to Frankfurt-style criticism. This alternative to the principle of alternate possibilities is so simplistic that it will no doubt strike many readers as philosophically fallow. I argue that it is not. I argue that the addition of one highly plausible premise allows for the modified principle to be employed in an argument for incompatibilism that begins with the observation that determinism rules out the ability to do otherwise. On the merits of this argument I conclude that deterministic moral responsibility is impossible and that Frankfurt's criticism of the principle of alternate possibilities-even if successful to that end-may be safely ignored.","Grinnell Coll, Grinnell, IA 50112 USA",,"Glatz, RM (corresponding author), Grinnell Coll, Grinnell, IA 50112 USA.",glatzr@grinell.edu,,,,,,,22,1,1,0,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0031-8116,,,PHILOS STUD,Philos.

They defend an appetitive account of curiosity, viewing curiosity as a motivationally original desire to know that arises from having one's attention drawn to the object and that in turn sustains one's attention to it. Distinguishing curiosity from wonder, the authors explore several sources of the epistemic value of curiosity. First, curiosity is tenacious: curiosity whether a proposition is true leads to curiosity about related issues, thereby deepening our knowledge. Second, it is to some extent biased in favor of topics in which we already have a practical or epistemic interest. Third, and most important, curiosity is largely independent of our interests: it fixes our attention on objects in which we have no antecedent interest, thereby broadening our knowledge. Schmitt and Lahroodi elucidate the value of curiosity by outlining its role in levels of development-an approach indebted to John Dewey's explanation of the value of curiosity. Finally, they raise some questions about the implications of their account for educational practice.","[Schmitt, Frederick F.] Indiana Univ, Dept Philosophy, Sycamore 026,1033 E Third St, Bloomington, IN 47401 USA; [Lahroodi, Reza] Univ Northern Iowa, Dept Philosophy & Relig, Philosophy, Cedar Falls, IA 50614 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; University of Northern Iowa,"Schmitt, FF (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Philosophy, Sycamore 026,1033 E Third St, Bloomington, IN 47401 USA.",fschmitt@indiana.edu; Reza.Lahroodi@uni.edu,,,,,,,36,47,79,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-2004,1741-5446,,EDUC THEORY,Educ.

This consequence is considered as a general constraint on a theory of knowledge attribution, and then further used to argue against the contextualist thesis that, in some cases, considering a new counter- possibility can raise the epistemic standard of knowledge attribution. Instead, the paper shows that considering a new counter-possibility can only lower the epistemic position of a putative knower. Moreover, since the comparison, by the nature of conditionals, is free from any commitment to the truth-values of specific knowledge attributions, my conclusion is free from the debate between contextualism and invariantism on whether the truth-value of a knowledge attribution can actually vary with context.","Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Philosophy, Chiayi 621, Taiwan",National Chung Cheng University,"Wang, LT (corresponding author), Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Philosophy, 168 Univ Rd, Chiayi 621, Taiwan.",lintonwang@ccu.edu.tw,,,,,,,35,1,1,0,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0039-7857,1573-0964,,SYNTHESE,Synthese,MAY,2008,162,1,,,,,133,156,,10.1007/s11229-007-9174-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11229-007-9174-9,,,24,History & Philosophy Of Science; Philosophy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),History & Philosophy of Science; Philosophy,279NY,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000254363100009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Then, in Sects. 3-4, it is argued that the externalistic re-definition of knowledge deprives this concept from useful applications to human's epistemic practice. From the viewpoint of cultural evolution, the condition of justification is the most important ingredient of knowledge. An alternative foundation-oriented conception of knowledge called third-person internalism is developed in Sect. 2 and Sect. 5. It combines insights of externalism with the requirement of second-order justification. The application of third-person internalism to contextualistic positions leads to an important constraint on contextualism (Sect. 6). The final section (Sect. 7) sketches new prospects for a foundation-oriented epistemology which are based on epistemic optimality arguments.","Univ Dusseldorf, Dept Philosophy, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany",Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf,"Schurz, G (corresponding author), Univ Dusseldorf, Dept Philosophy, Univ Str 1,Geb 23-21, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.",gerhard.schurz@phil-fak.uni-duesseldorf.de,,,,,,,32,8,8,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0353-5150,,,ACTA ANAL,Acta Anal.-Int.

Although this evidence may make the claimant's case more probable than not, imposing liability on Red Bus based on this evidence alone seems intuitively wrong. A common response to this scenario is to suggest that statistical evidence (such as market-share) is inferior to non-statistical evidence (such as eyewitness) in its ability to prove particular facts in court. Various scholars have put forward theories which identify the quality which statistical evidence lacks and which makes inferences from it epistemologically unwarranted. This article argues that these accounts fail to establish such an epistemic deficiency. It concludes that if there is a good justlfication to restrict the use of statistical evidence in court, it is not rooted in the epistemic qualities of the evidence itself; it has to be found elsewhere.","[Pundik, Amit] Univ Cambridge, Law, Hughes Hall, Cambridge, England",University of Cambridge,"Pundik, A (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Law, Hughes Hall, Cambridge, England.",,,,,,,,132,8,8,0,0,SWEET MAXWELL LTD,ANDOVER,"NORTH WAY, ANDOVER SP10 5BE, HANTS, ENGLAND",0261-9261,,,CIV JUSTICE Q,Civ.

In my concluding remarks, I will pay some attention to the following question: either in order to save normative epistemology, or in order to save the definition of analytical true sentence employed here, is it necessary to abandon any type of foundationalism, or it is sufficient to abandon just the type of foundationalism that aims to certainty?.","Univ Genoa, Dipartimento Filosofia, Genoa, Italy",University of Genoa,"Vassallo, N (corresponding author), Univ Genoa, Dipartimento Filosofia, Genoa, Italy.",nicla@nous.unige.it,,,,,,,41,0,0,0,3,FRANCO ANGELI EDIZIONI,MILAN,"VIALE MONZA 106, MILAN, 20127, ITALY",0392-9760,1825-652X,,EPISTEMOLOGIA,Epistemologia,JAN-JUN,2008,31,1,,,,,37,56,,,,,,20,History & Philosophy Of Science; Philosophy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),History & Philosophy of Science; Philosophy,350BW,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000259328500003,View Full Record in Web of Science

While agreeing with Pritchard in many respects, the paper questions the need for his concession to the sceptic that the neo-Moorean is capable at best of recovering 'brute' externalist knowledge. The paper discusses and directly responds to a dilemma that Pritchard poses for virtue epistemologies (VE). It also takes issue with Pritchard's merely safety-based alternative. Ultimately, however, the criticisms made here of Pritchard's dilemma and its underlying contrast of anti-luck and virtue epistemologies are intended to help realize his own aspirations for a better diagnosis of radical scepticism to inform a still better neo-Moorean response.","Univ Nevada, Dept Philosophy, Reno, NV 89557 USA",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno,"Axtell, G (corresponding author), Univ Nevada, Dept Philosophy, Mail Stop 102, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",axtell@unr.nevada.edu,,,,,,,34,5,5,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0039-7857,,,SYNTHESE,Synthese,OCT,2007,158,3,,,,,363,383,,10.1007/s11229-006-9045-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11229-006-9045-9,,,21,History & Philosophy Of Science; Philosophy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),History & Philosophy of Science; Philosophy,213HT,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000249658200008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Indeed, this is said to be the central difference between those true beliefs that qualify as knowledge and those that are true merely by luck-the former, unlike the latter, are achievements of the subject and are thereby creditable to her. Moreover, it is often further noted that deserving credit is what explains the additional value that knowledge has over merely lucky true belief. In this paper, I argue that the general conception of knowledge found in the DCVK is fundamentally incorrect. In particular, I show that deserving credit cannot be what distinguishes knowledge from merely lucky true belief since knowledge is not something for which a subject always deserves credit.","No Illinois Univ, Dept Philosophy, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA",Northern Illinois University,"Lackey, J (corresponding author), No Illinois Univ, Dept Philosophy, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA.",jlackey@niu.edu,,"Lackey, Jennifer/0000-0001-7754-248X",,,,,74,169,189,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0039-7857,,,SYNTHESE,Synthese,OCT,2007,158,3,,,,,345,361,,10.1007/s11229-006-9044-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11229-006-9044-x,,,17,History & Philosophy Of Science; Philosophy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),History & Philosophy of Science; Philosophy,213HT,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000249658200007,View Full Record in Web of Science

The philosophical debate is concentrating on mental states (or processes). If we characterize self-knowledge by natural language sentences, the most adequate utterance has a structure like I know that I am in mental state M. This common sense characterization has to be developed into an adequate description. In this investigation we will tackle two questions: (i) What precisely is the phenomenon referred to by self-knowledge and how can we adequately describe a form of self-knowledge which we might realistically enjoy? (ii) Can we have self-knowledge given the fact that the meaning of some words which we utter depends on the environment or the speech community? The theory we defend argues that we have to distinguish the public meaning of utterances, on the one hand, and the mental representations which are constituting a mental state of an individual, on the other. Self-knowledge should be characterized on the level of mental representations while the semantics of utterances self-attributing mental states should be treated separately. Externalism is only true for the public meaning of utterances but not for beliefs and other mental states including self-knowledge.","Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Philosophie, D-44801 Bochum, Germany",Ruhr University Bochum,"Newen, A (corresponding author), Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Philosophie, Univ Str,150, D-44801 Bochum, Germany.",albert.newen@rub.de,,"Vosgerau, Gottfried/0000-0002-4859-4237; Newen, Albert/0000-0001-5906-6061",,,,,48,8,8,0,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0165-0106,,,ERKENNTNIS,Erkenntnis,SEP,2007,67,2,,,,,337,353,,10.1007/s10670-007-9071-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10670-007-9071-0,,,17,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,216ZM,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000249917700015,View Full Record in Web of Science

This oversight becomes clear when we turn from the eccentric example of the industrial chicken-sexer to the case of the survivor of sexual violence. What we have in this instance is a subject who, qua survivor, has certain reliably formed, that is, non-accidentally true, beliefs about which she has deep conviction, but which she cannot defend because she has blocked from memory the details of her traumatic experience. She is super blindsighted. In light of the universality and everydayness of sexual violence this phenomenon is, I conclude, run of the mill.

Contextualist theories explain this variation in terms of semantic hypotheses that refer to standards of justification determined by practical features of either the subject's context (Hawthorne & Stanley) or the ascriber's context (Lewis, Cohen, & DeRose). There is extensive linguistic counter-evidence to both forms. I maintain that the contextual variation of knowledge claims is better explained by common pragmatic factors. I show here that one is variable strictness. S knows p is commonly used loosely to implicate S is close enough to knowing p for contextually indicated purposes. A pragmatic account may use a range of semantics, even contextualist. I use an invariant semantics on which knowledge requires complete justification. This combination meets the Moorean constraint as well as any linguistic theory should, and meets the intuition constraint much better than contextualism. There is no need for ad hoc error theories. The variation in conditions of assertability and practical rationality is better explained by variably strict constraints. It will follow that S knows p is used loosely to implicate that the condition for asserting p and using it in practical reasoning are satisfied.","Georgetown Univ, Dept Philosophy, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Georgetown University,"Davis, WA (corresponding author), Georgetown Univ, Dept Philosophy, New N Bldg,Room 215,37th & O St,NW, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",davisw@georgetown.edu,,,,,,,71,79,83,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0031-8116,1573-0883,,PHILOS STUD,Philos.

Difficulties for this condition are now well documented. Keith DeRose has recently suggested a revised sensitivity condition that is designed to avoid some of these difficulties. We argue, however, that there are decisive objections to DeRose's revised condition. Yet rather than simply abandoning his proposed condition, we uncover a rationale for its adoption, a rationale which suggests a further revision that avoids our objections as well as others. The payoff is considerable: along the way to our revision, we learn lessons about the epistemic significance of certain explanatory relations, about how we ought to envisage epistemic closure principles, and about the epistemic significance of methods of belief formation.","Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Philosophy, Northridge, CA 91330 USA; Univ Tennessee, Dept Philosophy, Knoxville, TN USA",California State University System; California State University Northridge; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Black, T (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Philosophy, Northridge, CA 91330 USA.",tim.black@csun.edu; pjmurphy469@yahoo.com,,,,,,,11,34,35,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0039-7857,,,SYNTHESE,Synthese,JAN,2007,154,1,,,,,53,71,,10.1007/s11229-005-8487-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11229-005-8487-9,,,19,History & Philosophy Of Science; Philosophy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),History & Philosophy of Science; Philosophy,121EY,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000243142100003,View Full Record in Web of Science

J,"Tedre, M",,,,"Tedre, Matti",,,Know Your Discipline: Teaching the Philosophy of Computer Science,JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION-RESEARCH,,,English,Article,,,,,,philosophy of computer science; foundations of computer science; computer science education; course description,,"The diversity and interdisciplinarity of computer science and the multiplicity of its uses in other sciences make it hard to define computer science and to prescribe how computer science should be carried out. The diversity of computer science also causes friction between computer scientists from different branches. Computer science curricula, as they stand, have been criticized for being unable to offer computer scientists proper methodological training or a deep understanding of different research traditions. At the Department of Computer Science and Statistics at the University of Joensuu we decided to include in our curriculum a course that offers our students an awareness of epistemological and methodological issues in computer science, and we wanted to design the course to be meaningful forpracticing computer scientists. In this article the needs and aims of our course on the philosophy of computer science are discussed, and the structure and arrangements-the whys, whats, and hows-of that course are explained. The course, which is given entirely on-line, was designed for advanced graduate or postgraduate computer science students from two Finnish universities: the University of Joensuu and the University of Kuopio. The course has four relatively broad themes, and all those themes are tied to the students ' everyday work or their own research topics. I have prepared course readings about each of those four themes. The course readings describe, in a compact and simple form, the cruces of the topics that are discussed in the course. The electronic version of the course readings includes hyperlinks to a large number of articles that are available on-line. The course readings are publicly available on the course home page, and they are licensed under the creative commons license. The first theme in the course is centered around a fundamental question-What is computer science? Students are introduced to the disciplinary history of computer science, to a number of characterizations of computer science made by the pioneers of the discipline, and to some methodological and epistemological viewpoints on computer science. The second theme is centered around the question-What is science? Students are introduced to, for instance, the concepts of pure and applied science, '' hard '' and '' soft '' sciences, the aims of science, the scientific method, scientific reasoning, the formation of scientific concepts and theories, and the Science Wars. The third theme concerns the division of computer science into its theoretical, engineering, and empirical traditions. The lecture notes introduce the students to descriptions of computer science that emphasize the mathematical tradition over other traditions and to descriptions that emphasize engineering or empirical traditions. The fourth theme is the philosophy of science. Throughout the course terminology of the philosophy of science is used, and the students are introduced to a number of central issues in the philosophy of science, to some of the most notable schools in the philosophy of science, and to some critical views of science. This course is aimed at providing a broad understanding of the different traditions of computer science, of the methodological differences between the branches of computer science, of the strengths and limitations of the different traditions in computer science, and of how the philosophy of science can be of help to computer scientists. In the course, critical reading and well-argumented writing are encouraged. The students learn that there are many problems that do not have clear-cut answers; they learn that there are many open problems where multiple incompatible, yet credible viewpoints can be defended. The students also learn to articulate their own positions, to defend those positions, to comment and criticize other positions, and to reflect and rethink their positions according to criticism. The students also get the chance to think about the intellectual foundations of their own work and their own research studies.","[Tedre, Matti] Univ Joensuu, Dept Comp Sci & Stat, Joensuu, Finland",University of Eastern Finland,"Tedre, M (corresponding author), Univ Joensuu, Dept Comp Sci & Stat, Joensuu, Finland.",matti.tedre@cs.joensuu.fi,,,East Finland Graduate School in Computer Science and Engineering (ECSE); National Institute for International Education (NIIED) of the Korean Government,East Finland Graduate School in Computer Science and Engineering (ECSE); National Institute for International Education (NIIED) of the Korean Government,This work was funded by the East Finland Graduate School in Computer Science and Engineering (ECSE) and the National Institute for International Education (NIIED) of the Korean Government.,,97,7,8,0,4,INFORMING SCIENCE INST,SANTA ROSA,"131 BROOKHILL CT, SANTA ROSA, CA 95409 USA",1547-9714,1539-3585,,J INF TECHNOL EDUC-R,J.

An answer to this challenge is to deny that the truth of p is a necessary condition to know that p. This is a relativist answer. In this case, the concept of knowledge will change. A second option implies sustaining this condition, which drives to agnosticism. In this case, ignorance is not any more the contrary of knowledge, but is at another level. When one holds the relativistic thesis, one will be able to justify the reproach that is usually made to some type of ignorance, but at the price of holding a contra-intuitive concept of knowledge. The agnostic thesis, however, does not have the negative consequences of the relativist concept of knowledge, but it does not allow to criticize anybody because of their ignorance.","[Vilajosana, Josep M.] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University,"Vilajosana, JM (corresponding author), Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.",,"Vilajosana, Josep M./AAA-1346-2019","Vilajosana, Josep M./0000-0001-8416-2418",,,,,6,0,0,0,1,UNIV ALICANTE,ALICANTE,"APARTADO DE CORREOS 99, ALICANTE, 3080, SPAIN",0214-8676,,,DOXA,Doxa,,2007,30,,,,,,217,221,,,,,,5,Philosophy,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Philosophy,V8T1B,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000421942200031,View Full Record in Web of Science

At the same time, the justification component of Plato's definition did not have a formal representation. This paper introduces the notion of justification into formal epistemology. Epistemic logic with justification, along with the usual knowledge operator 'F (F is known), contains assertions t:F (t is a justification for F). We study two basic systems, S4LP and S4LPN, of epistemic logic with justification and show completeness with respect to natural epistemic semantics, which augments Kripke models with a natural Fitting-style treatment of justification assertions t:F.

Though her hypothesis has attracted considerable critical attention, much of it, in my view, misses the point. In this paper I vigorously defend Maddy's (1990) account against published criticisms, not because I think it is true, but because these criticisms have functioned to obscure a more fundamental issue that is well worth addressing: in general - and not only in the mathematical domain - empiricism and realism simply cannot be reconciled by means of an account of perception anything like Maddy's. But because Maddy's account of perception is so plausible, this conclusion raises the specter of the broader incompatibility of realism and empiricism, which contemporary philosophers are frequently at pains to forget.","Lehigh Univ, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA",Lehigh University,"Levine, A (corresponding author), Lehigh Univ, 15 Univ Dr, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA.",,,,,,,,26,1,1,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0039-7857,,,SYNTHESE,Synthese,JUL,2005,145,3,,,,,425,448,,10.1007/s11229-005-6202-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11229-005-6202-5,,,24,History & Philosophy Of Science; Philosophy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),History & Philosophy of Science; Philosophy,951WY,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000230964300007,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, I offer a solution to the problem which takes belief-independent processes to be functions that take as inputs information about distal states of affairs, and produce beliefs as outputs. Processes are individuated narrowly, so as to avoid the latter aspect of the Generality problem, but, by holding process tokens to be of the same type when they take perceptually equivalent scenes as inputs, and produce beliefs of the same kind as outputs, the former aspect of the problem is avoided too. Having argued that this method of typing process tokens solves the Generality Problem, I then argue that my solution does not fall prey to objections that have been, or might be, raised for similar proposals.","Hofstra Univ, Dept Philosophy & Relig Studies, Hempstead, NY 11549 USA",Hofstra University,"Hofstra Univ, Dept Philosophy & Relig Studies, Hempstead, NY 11549 USA.",phimvm@hofstra.edu,,,,,,,12,7,7,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-2017,1746-8361,,DIALECTICA,Dialectica,,2005,59,1,,,,,19,35,,10.1111/j.1746-8361.2005.01002.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1746-8361.2005.01002.x,,,17,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,950PH,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000230868900003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Now the analysis of the relationship between cognition and action makes it possible to establish that knowing always means acting, whether in view of knowledge as such, for which action appears to be a necessary condition for more than one reason, or whether in view of anything but knowledge, which appears to be a necessary condition for more than one reason, or whether in view of anything but knowledge, which appears to be a tool for numerous ends that it is the task of action to specify. Hence by drawing inspiration from the investigations of analytical philosophy into speech acts, it is possible to distinguish several types of acts of knowledge, in particular cognitive, incognitive and precognitive acts. Acts of knowledge thus make it possible to propose a pragmatic solution to the problem of Gettier, which, limited to the framework of epistemic analysis, appears as a pseudo-problem without a solution. Knowledge accordingly always presupposes a cognitive act, which, in function of the intention and the cognitive capacity of the subject in a given situation, assigns a value of justification to certain epistemic conditions.",,,"Lavelle, S (corresponding author), 69bis Rue Boucher De Perthes, F-58900 Lille, France.",sylvain.lavelle@icam.fr,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,0,INST SUPERIEUR PHILOSOPHIE,LOUVAIN LA NEUVE,"COLLEGE THOMAS MORE (SH3), B-1348 LOUVAIN LA NEUVE, BELGIUM",0035-3841,,,REV PHILOS LOUVAIN,Rev.

In philosophy, this interest has tended to focus not upon luck simpliciter but rather upon the role that luck plays in ethical and epistemological debates concerning (respectively) moral and epistemic luck. In psychology, in contrast, a number of studies have explicitly examined our everyday conceptions of luck and the manner in which these conceptions influence our lives. This article surveys both the recent psychological and philosophical literature on this topic and argues that (to different degrees) the work of both disciplines in this area has been hampered by a failure to be clearer about what luck involves. Accordingly, this article offers a specification of what is core to the notion of luck and highlights how this analysis can aid further research in this area by both psychologists and philosophers.

Also questioned is the selection of guests to the dinner party as reflecting a male and Eurocentric bias that masks the centrality of identity social location, and power in the construction of knowledge.

J,"Williamson, T",,,,"Williamson, T",,,Philosophical 'intuitions' and scepticism about judgement,DIALECTICA,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"1. What are called 'intuitions' in philosophy are just applications of our ordinary capacities for judgement. We think of them as intuitions when a special kind of scepticism about those capacities is salient. 2. Like scepticism about perception, scepticism about judgement pressures us into conceiving our evidence as facts about our internal psychological states: here, facts about our conscious inclinations to make judgements about some topic rather than facts about the topic itself. But the pressure should be resisted, for it rests on bad epistemology: specifically, on an impossible ideal of unproblematically identifiable evidence. 3. Our resistance to scepticism about judgement is not simply epistemic conservatism, for we resist it on behalf of others as well as ourselves. A reason is needed for thinking that beliefs tend to be true. 4. Evolutionary explanations of the tendency assume what they should explain. Explanations that appeal to constraints on the determination of reference are more promising. Davidson's truth-maximizing principle of charity is examined but rejected. 5. An alternative principle is defended on which the nature of reference is to maximize knowledge rather than truth. It is related to an externalist conception of mind on which knowing is the central mental state. 6. The knowledge-maximizing principle of charity explains why scenarios for scepticism about judgement do not warrant such scepticism, although it does not explain how we know in any particular case. We should face the fact that evidence is always liable to be contested in philosophy, and stop using talk of intuition to disguise this unpleasant truth from ourselves.","Univ Oxford, Fac Philos, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Univ Oxford, Fac Philos, Oxford, England.",timothy.williamson@philosophy.oxford.ac.uk,,,,,,,40,116,138,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-2017,1746-8361,,DIALECTICA,Dialectica,,2004,58,1,,,,,109,153,,,,,,45,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,858NZ,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000224200300006,View Full Record in Web of Science

The conditions are subjective in that they are taken from the perspective of an agent's perception of his own state of knowledge or belief with respect to his observable world. Belief is measured along a series of linguistic degrees, e.g., strongly believes, fairly confidently believes, somewhat disbelieves, etc., and knowledge is taken as unequivocal belief. The system employs a novel, dual-leveled language that follows fuzzy logic by interpreting the logical or and and as the arithmetical max and min. Numerous properties of Sigma, illustrating its intuitive appeal for the intended purpose, are derived. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

This article demonstrates that it is a philosophically troubling sort of luck; causing problems in, at least, ethics and political philosophy. Some, notably Susan Hurley, Nicholas Rescher, and Daniel Statman, have argued that such trouble can be avoided, by pointing out that the notion fo constitutive luck is incoherent. The article examines this claim by means of a discussion of the idea of luck in general, settling on an account of luck in terms of the notions of chance, value, and (lack of) control. This account is then sued to show that the notion of constitutive luck is not incoherent. We are stuck with the problems made by constitutive luck.","Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Philosophy, St Johns, NF A1C 5S7, Canada",Memorial University Newfoundland,"Latus, A (corresponding author), Mem Univ Newfoundland, Dept Philosophy, St Johns, NF A1C 5S7, Canada.",,,,,,,,24,27,39,0,4,BLACKWELL PUBL LTD,OXFORD,"108 COWLEY RD, OXFORD OX4 1JF, OXON, ENGLAND",0026-1068,,,METAPHILOSOPHY,Metaphilosophy,JUL,2003,34,4,,,,,460,475,,10.1111/1467-9973.00285,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-9973.00285,,,16,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,742JC,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000186512800004,View Full Record in Web of Science

This essay examines the problem of luck as a metaphilosophical problem spanning the division between subfields in philosophy. I first explore the analogies between ethical and epistemic luck by comparing influential attempts to expunge luck from our conceptions of agency in these two subfields. I then focus upon Duncan Pritchard's challenge to the motivations underlying virtue epistemology, based specifically on its handling of the problem of epistemic luck. I argue that (1) consideration of the multifold nature of the problem of epistemic luck to an adequate account of human knowledge drives us to a mixed externalist epistemology; and (2) the virtue-theoretical approach presents a particularly advantageous way of framing and developing a mixed externalist epistemology.","Univ Nevada, Dept Philosophy, Reno, NV 89557 USA",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno,"Axtell, G (corresponding author), Univ Nevada, Dept Philosophy, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",,,,,,,,53,7,7,0,0,BLACKWELL PUBL LTD,OXFORD,"108 COWLEY RD, OXFORD OX4 1JF, OXON, ENGLAND",0026-1068,,,METAPHILOSOPHY,Metaphilosophy,APR,2003,34,3,,,,,331,352,,10.1111/1467-9973.00277,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-9973.00277,,,22,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,678NH,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000182873000006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Significantly, however, it is argued that the two main varieties of virtue epistemology are responding to different types of epistemic luck. In particular, whilst proponents of reliabilism-based virtue theories have been focusing on the problem of what I call veritic epistemic luck, non- reliabilism-based virtue theories have instead been concerned with a very different type of epistemic luck, what I call reflective epistemic luck. It is argued that, prima facie at least, both forms of epistemic luck need to be responded to by adequate epistemological theory. The problem, however, is that one can best eliminate veritic epistemic luck by adducing a so-called safety- based epistemological theory that need not be allied to a virtue-based account, and there is no fully adequate way of eliminating reflective epistemic luck.

Nevertheless, the solution offered is in the spirit of the constructivist attitude usually maintained by defenders of the anti-realist premise.

The contributors argue that Gettier's examples do not demonstrate that this analysis is wrong. In their view, Gettier, on the one hand, incorrectly claims that the epistemic subject in his examples does not know what he is supposed to know, in accordance with the traditional definition of knowledge; on the other hand, one of the contributors maintains that Gettier's epistemic subject, under a certain reading of know that, indeed does not know what in Gettier's opinion the definition would require that s/he knows, but in point of fact the definition provides for the opposite of it, i.e. it makes us expect that s/he really does not possess the respective knowledge. The author shows that the arguments examined in the article and aimed at a refutation of Gettier's claim of inadequacy of the traditional definition of knowledge are ill conceived and miss the mark; among other things, at one point, an ambiguity of know that has wrongly been assumed. The author resumes his contention (stated in his other works) that Gettier's valid critique paves the way towards a correct understanding of 'know that', viz. towards its understanding as the most fundamental semantic prime (which is susceptible to NO definition).

J,"Pettit, D",,,,"Pettit, D",,,Why knowledge is unnecessary for understanding language (Against the epistemic view),MIND,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"It is a natural thought that understanding language consists in possessing knowledge--to understand a word is to know what it means. It is also natural to suppose that this knowledge is propositional knowledge--to know what a word means is to know that it means such-and-such. Thus it is prima facie plausible to suppose that understanding a bit of language consists in possessing propositional knowledge of its meaning. I refer to this as the epistemic view of understanding language. The theoretical appeal of this view for the philosophy of language is that it provides for an attractive account of the project of the theory of meaning. If understanding language consists in possessing propositional knowledge of the meanings of expressions, then a meaning theory amounts to a theory of what speakers know in virtue of understanding language. In this paper I argue that, despite its intuitive and theoretical appeal, the epistemic view is false. Propositional knowledge is not necessary for understanding language, not even tacit knowledge. Unlike knowledge, I argue, linguistic understanding does not fail in Gettier cases, does not require epistemic warrant and does not even require belief. The intuitions about knowledge that have been central to epistemology do not seem to hold for linguistic understanding. So unless epistemologists have been radically mistaken about what knowledge requires , knowledge is unnecessary for understanding language.","MIT, Dept Linguist & Philos, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"MIT, Dept Linguist & Philos, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",pettit@mit.edu,,,,,,,15,41,44,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0026-4423,1460-2113,,MIND,Mind,JUL,2002,111,443,,,,,519,550,,10.1093/mind/111.443.519,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mind/111.443.519,,,32,Philosophy,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Philosophy,575MK,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000176949900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

If we are interested in explaining intentional actions rather than intentions or attempts, we need to make reference to more than the agent's beliefs and desires. It is easy to see how the truth of your beliefs, or perhaps, facts about a setting will be involved in the explanation of an action. It you believe you can stop your car by pressing a pedal, then, it your belief is true, you will stop. If it is false, you will not. By considering cases of unintentional actions, actions involving luck and cases of deviant causal chains, I show why knowledge is required. By looking at the notion of causal relevance, I argue that the connection between knowledge and action is causal and not merely conceptual.","NYU, New York, NY 10012 USA",New York University,"Gibbons, J (corresponding author), NYU, New York, NY 10012 USA.",,,,,,,,22,51,55,0,1,PHILOSOPHY PHENOMENOLOGICAL RES,PROVIDENCE,"BROWN UNIV BOX 1947, PROVIDENCE, RI 02912 USA",0031-8205,,,PHILOS PHENOMEN RES,Philos.

It is, nevertheless, acknowledged by a number of epistemologists that some kind of luck is in fact an inevitable component of the process of knowledge acquisition.

This suggests the idea of approaching the a priori through the topic of evidence (or reasons). The paper begins with discussion of our use of intuitions as evidence(reasons) in the a priori disciplines (logic, mathematics, philosophy) and an argument showing that omitting intuitions from one's body of evidence leads to epistemic self-defeat. This is followed by an explanation of why intuitions are evidence. The explanation is provided by modal reliabilism -the doctrine that there is a certain kind of qualified modal tie between intuitions and the truth. Finally, this tie to the truth is explained by the theory of concept possession: it is a direct consequence of what it is, by definition, to possess- to undertstand-the concepts involved in our intuitions. The resulting picture is then shown to imply a qualified autonomy of each of the a priori disciplines vis-a-vis empirical science.","Univ Colorado, Dept Philosophy, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Bealer, G (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Philosophy, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",,,,,,,,17,93,112,0,7,BLACKWELL PUBL LTD,OXFORD,"108 COWLEY RD, OXFORD OX4 1JF, OXON, ENGLAND",0031-5621,,,PAC PHILOS QUART,Pac.

I then argue that externalist theories of justification cannot close the gap between mere true belief and knowledge. I suggest that a fourth condition on knowledge is required, regardless of whether justification is internalist or externalist. I argue that with such a fourth condition a strong internalist theory of justification is adequate to the task that remains in making true belief knowledge. Additionally, strong internalism is more satisfying to our intuitions than externalism and mixed forms of justification.","Univ Alabama, Dept Philosophy, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Harper, W (corresponding author), Univ Alabama, Dept Philosophy, POB 870218, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",wharper@bama.ua.edu,,,,,,,25,1,1,0,0,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0039-7857,,,SYNTHESE,Synthese,,1998,116,1,,,,,27,49,,10.1023/A:1005014714579,http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1005014714579,,,23,History & Philosophy Of Science; Philosophy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),History & Philosophy of Science; Philosophy,154XJ,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:000077915300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

I present a new account of this debate, one which fits well with entrenched views on the I-E distinction and illuminates the fundamental disagreements at the heart of the debate. Roughly speaking, the I-E debate is over whether or not certain of the necessary conditions of positive epistemic status are internal. But what is the sense of 'internal' here? And of which conditions of which positive epistemic status are we speaking? I argue that an adequate answer to these questions requires reference to what I call the no-defeater condition which is satisfied by a subject's belief B just in case she does not believe that B is defeated.

We present a single rule, in the context of a knowledge-representation and reasoning system, that holds for all P, including those containing quasi-indexicals. In so doing, we explore the difference between reasoning in a public communication language and in a knowledge-representation language, we demonstrate the importance of representing proper names explicitly, and we provide support for the necessity of considering sentences in the context of extended discourse (e.g., written narrative) in order to fully capture certain features of their semantics.","NEW MEXICO STATE UNIV,LAS CRUCES,NM 88003",New Mexico State University,"Rapaport, WJ (corresponding author), SUNY BUFFALO,DEPT COMP SCI,BUFFALO,NY 14260, USA.",,,,,,,,91,16,18,0,2,ABLEX PUBL CORP,GREENWICH,"55 OLD POST RD NO.2, PO BOX 5297, GREENWICH, CT 06831-0504",0364-0213,,,COGNITIVE SCI,Cogn.

The genetic view of knowledge implies that teachers need to help learners construct their own knowledge, but it also implies that teachers (as learners) need to construct their own knowledge of student learning. These two implications are not always in harmony. The issue is further explored by considering two specific problems with teacher beliefs: that they are apt to be situated, not general, and that they are apt to be tacit, not explicit. The first problem is addressed by distinguishing between reproducible and plausible inferences, and the second problem is discussed in connection with the importance of language in knowledge growth. The upshot is a normative ideal that has teachers discussing plausible views about student learning in an explicit way.",,,"Orton, RE (corresponding author), UNIV MINNESOTA,MINNEAPOLIS,MN 55455, USA.",,,,,,,,42,9,20,0,3,BLACKWELL PUBLISHERS,CAMBRIDGE,"350 MAIN STREET, STE 6, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02148-5023",0362-6784,,,CURRICULUM INQ,Curric.

(Throughout, knowledge - whether individual or common - is defined as true belief.) Section 1 introduces the formal method of axiomatization followed by epistemic logicians, especially the syntax-semantics distinction, and the notion of a soundness and completeness theorem. Section 2 explains the syntactical concepts, while briefly discussing their motivations. Two standard semantic constructions, Kripke structures and neighbourhood structures, are introduced in Sections 3 and 4, respectively. It is recalled that Aumann's partitional model of CK is a particular case of a definition in terms of Kripke structures. The paper also restates the well-known fact that Kripke structures can be regarded as particular cases of neighbourhood structures. Section 3 reviews the soundness and completeness theorems proved w.r.t. the former structures by Fagin, Halpern, Moses and Vardi, as well as related results by Lismont. Section 4 reviews the corresponding theorems derived w.r.t. the latter structures by Lismont and Mongin. A general conclusion of the paper is that the axiomatization of CB does not require as strong systems of individual belief as was originally thought - only monotonicity has thus far proved indispensable. Section 5 explains another consequence of general relevance: despite the ''infinitary'' nature of CB, the axiom systems of this paper admit of effective decision procedures, i.e., they are decidable in the logician's sense.","UNIV CATHOLIQUE LOUVAIN,CNRS,B-1348 LOUVAIN,BELGIUM; UNIV CATHOLIQUE LOUVAIN,CORE,B-1348 LOUVAIN,BELGIUM",Universite Catholique Louvain; Universite Catholique Louvain,"LISMONT, L (corresponding author), ECOLES HAUTES ETUD SCI SOCIALES,GREOE,MARSEILLE,FRANCE.",,,,,,,,57,34,39,0,2,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,JUL,1994,37,1,,,,,75,106,,10.1007/BF01079206,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01079206,,,32,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,NX712,,,,,2024-07-12,WOS:A1994NX71200004,View Full Record in Web of Science

At the same time that the sociology of scientific knowledge has opened up the content of science to social analysis, it has undermined the bases for such ideology critique, Barnes's attempt to rehabilitate a critical conception of ideology fails to provide for robust critique, and reintroduces an asymmetry - earlier banished - between instrumentalism and concealed social interest An alternative approach to ideology is proposed, that dispenses with appeals to demarcation criteria or the interrogation of motives. Instead, ideology should be seen as a particular effect of many signifying practices within and outside science - the establishment or maintenance of disparities of power in society.

Conventional wisdom concerning the principle fails to express the full range of values at stake in preserving the rule of law. In order to appreciate the deeper significance of these values, this Article considers an application of the principle of legality to a dispute about mens rea rather than to a controversy about actus reus. This discussion helps to reveal some of the larger issues that are involved in protecting the principle of legality. In addition, a focus on mens ma indicates the limitations of statutory solutions to some of the problems raised by the principle. Finally, this perspective demonstrates how the rule of law serves to protect law-abiding persons, and not only scoundrels. The most general conclusion drawn is that fidelity to law cannot be construed merely as fidelity to statutory law, but must be understood as fidelity to the principles of justice that underlie statutory law. The deeper significance of the principle of legality is revealed in the context of a discussion of the problem of wilful ignorance. The discussion begins by clearly characterizing the culpable mental state associated with wilful ignorance. The unsatisfactory treatment of wilful ignorance by both courts and commentators is then reviewed. This Article shows that some (but not all) wilfully ignorant defendants are held liable despite their failure to satisfy the mens ma requirement of the statutes under which they are convicted.

Since knowledge is not itself observable, criteria are needed for reasonable decisions to be made about how to classify different intellectual states, such as false belief, empirically true belief, necessary knowledge. In Piagetian research, there are two distinct views about the selection of such 'response criteria'. One view states that knowledge can be attributed on the basis of children's judgements-alone (J-view). A contrary view states that such attribution requires children to justify their judgements (JJ-view). An objection to the J-view is discussed by consideration of the two dominant philosophical accounts as to the nature of knowledge, namely the foundationalist and causal accounts. It is argued, firstly, that the foundationalist account requires the elimination of the J-view with which it is incompatible through its failure to deal with cases of knowledge at all. It is argued, secondly, that the causal account places a limitation on the J-view which fails to deal with cases of necessary knowledge. Since one of the main problems in Piagetian research is the construction of necessary knowledge, only the JJ-view should be used when this problem is addressed. Developmental research which is based on the J-view alone could not, without circularity, be concerned with the substantive issues which are outside its conceptual scope.",,,"SMITH, L (corresponding author), UNIV LANCASTER,DEPT EDUC RES,LANCASTER LA1 4YL,ENGLAND.",,,,,,,,85,27,27,0,0,BRITISH PSYCHOLOGICAL SOC,LEICESTER,"ST ANDREWS HOUSE, 48 PRINCESS RD EAST, LEICESTER, LEICS, ENGLAND LE1 7DR",0261-510X,,,BRIT J DEV PSYCHOL,Br.

Stephen Stich (et tu Stich) has contributed his design for epistemology's coffin. I look hard at his proposed radical revision of epistemology. The ostensible target of Stich's analysis is the traditional enterprise of analytic epistemology. It is, however, the conceptual pillars that underpin both the traditional analytic and naturalist epistemologies that are the primary focus. It is a conceptual domain neutral to the priorists and naturalists which Stich calls normative cognitive monism. Normative cognitive monism is the view that there is a unique system of cognitive processes that people should use. The point of Stich's analytical exercise is to disabuse us of the belief that there is such a unique and global set of standards by which cognitive performance is to be evaluated. He argues that all the evidence, both empirical and conceptual, leads away from this ultimately chauvinistic view and converges on normative cognitive pluralism which is the denial of monism. The same evidence that informs normative cognitive monism confirms normative cognitive pluralism. The empirical evidence is provided by the results of celebrated experiments on reasoning, or as Stich calls it, cognitive performance. The conceptual evidence derives from the failure of naturalistic accounts of intentional content. Stich's (1983) derisive view of theories of intentional content adumbrated in From Folk Psychology to Cognitive Science is now the linchpin of his pragmatic theory of cognitive evaluation.",,,"SILVER, S (corresponding author), CLEMSON UNIV,CLEMSON,SC 29634, USA.",,,,,,,,38,2,2,0,3,CARFAX PUBL CO,ABINGDON,"PO BOX 25, ABINGDON, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND OX14 3UE",0951-5089,,,PHILOS PSYCHOL,Philos.
